Bloodlines of Illuminati

by

Fritz Springmeier

Introduction

I am pleased & honored to present this book to those in the world who love the truth *end* This is a book
for lovers of the Truth *end* This is a book for those who are already familiar with my past writings *end* An
Illuminati Grand Master once said that the world is a stage and we are all actors *end* Of course this was
not an original thought but it certainly is a way of describing the Illuminati view of how the world
works *end*
The people of the world are an audience to which the Illuminati entertain with propaganda *end* Just one of
the thousands of recent examples of this type of acting done for the public was President Bill Clinton’s
 State of the Union address *end* The speech was designed to push all of the warm fuzzy buttons of his
listening audience that he could *end* All the green lights  for acceptance were systematically pushed by the
President’s speech with the help of a controlled congressional audience *end* The truth on the other hand
doesn’t always tickle the ear and warm the ego of its listeners *end* The light of truth in this book will be
too bright for some people who  will want to return to the safe comfort of their darkness *end*
I am not a conspiracy theorist *end* I deal with real facts not theory *end* Some of the people I write about I
have met *end* Some of the people I expose are alive and very dangerous *end* The darkness has never liked the
light *end* Yet many of the secrets of the Illuminati are locked up tightly simply because secrecy is a way
of life *end* It is such a way of life that they resent the Carroll Quigleys and the James H *end* Billingtons who
want to tell real historical facts rather than doctored up stories and myths *end* I have been an intense
student of history since I could read and I am deeply committed to the facts of history rather than the
cover stories the public is fed to manipulate them *end*
I do not fear the Illuminati taking over this country and doing away with the Constitution because
they took over this country long ago and  the Constitution has not technically been in effect due to
Presidential emergency decrees since W.W *end* II *end* Being a follower of Christ does not mean we should
fear *end* Perfect love for Almighty God casts out our fear for the  situation He has place us in *end* Don’t think
for a moment you are going to vote the Illuminati out of office *end* They control the major and minor
political  parties *end* They control the process of government they control the process  of information
flow they control the process of creating money and finally  they control Christendom *end* However
God controls the hearts of His people *end*
I have provided information on how to respond in some of my other writings *end* This book will not tell
you how to deal with the Illuminati families *end* This volume is simply the first of two volumes which is
published to give an overview of what the Illuminati is *end* In short the Illuminati are generational Satanic
bloodlines which have gained the most power *end* A generational Satanist described the Illuminati as
"Satan’s elite."

This book is not written to cause fear *end* It is not written to provide names for a witch hunt *end* It is not
written to provide another theory *end* This book is not about a theory *end* It is about the secret occult
oligarchies  which rule the world *end* When brought together the facts of this book will begin to speak for
themselves without me *end* I don’t ask that you take my word *end* Investigate for yourself *end* God Himself has
told us that the whole world lies in the power of the wicked one *end* Some people after they have read my
material have gone out into their own geographic area and seen for themselves that a small group of
people control their nation and the world from behind the scenes *end* They have seen for themselves the
power that secret societies exercise from behind the scenes *end*


This book will not be error free *end* There will be typos and misspelled names and errors of various
kinds *end* The author is not God Almighty *end* I do not have every hair on these people’s heads counted *end* This
book has not been put out with the luxury of ghost writers editors a paid staff of researchers and a
large budget *end* I look at many trivial projects which the elite are able to pour millions of dollars into
and I look at the research I do when at times I’ve not had a dime to photocopy some document I want *end* There is so much for me to communicate about the Illuminati who  they are what their rituals are like
and how they control the world that it has taken several years of writing to begin to give people a fully
cohesive picture *end*
Finally after a number of requests that I assemble my writings exposing the top  Illuminati
bloodlines I have taken the time to put it all together in a book with a comprehensive index *end* History is
important *end* In order to know where we are going we need to know where we have been *end* To control the
past is to control the present *end* The Illuminati’s control over the entire learning process from cradle to
grave gives them great ability to shape our frames of references *end* Jesus spoke about historical things *end* Paul reminded people of historical things *end* Josephus wrote a history of the nation of Israel *end*
Long ago in the dark unwritten pages of human history powerful kings discovered how they could
control other men by torture magical practices wars politics religion and interest taking *end* These elite
families designed strategies and tactics to perpetuate their occult practices *end* Layers upon layers of
secrecy have hidden these families from the profane masses but many an author has touched upon
their existence *end* I began my research when I began to get first hand reports from very informed people
that an elite group did rule the world *end* My research into Satan’s hierarchy went fast because of my
skills as a researcher and because I knew from the beginning from my informants about the reality of
what I was investigating *end* My investigation into the Illuminati led me to read and pray about thousands
of books *end* The quantity of books newspapers magazines and manuscripts and papers which were read
to get me to where I am today numbers in the many thousands *end* I do not know how many nights I
stayed up studying and finally collapsed into sleep with blurred red eyes *end*
I do know that I was driven enough in my study that I often would not stop until my eyes and mind
could go no further *end* Men and women with sharp intellects like Edith Star Miller author of Occult
Theocracy and Alexander Hislop author of The Two Babylons have tried to research the occult
world and the connections between the different groups *end* I first read Hislop’s book in  *end* His book
shows that there is a continuity between the ancient occultism of the Mystery Religions and modern
day religion *end* Edith Star Miller’s Occult Theocracy was very helpful for me to rapidly see some of the
many hidden historical and operational connections between occult groups today *end* Finally the book
Holy Blood *end* Holy Grail and its first sequel The Messianic Legacy gave me a deep insightful look into
the  bloodline *end* But my understanding has been lifted by countless other investigators who are
worthy of praise because they dared to challenge the power structure to get to the real facts *end* </p>

In mockery and imitation of God’s  tribes Satan blessed  bloodlines *end* One of these bloodlines was
the Ishmaeli bloodline from which a special elite line developed alchemy assassination techniques
and other occult practices *end* One bloodline was Egyptian/Celtic/Druidic from which Druidism was
developed *end* One bloodline was in the orient and developed oriental magic *end* One lineage was from
Canaan and the Canaanites *end* It had the name Astarte then Astorga then Ashdor and then Astor *end* The
tribe of Dan was used as a Judas Iscariot type seed *end* The royalty of the tribe of Dan have descended
down through history as a powefful Satanic bloodline *end* The  or final blood line was copied after
God’s royal lineage of Jesus *end* This was the Satanic House of David with their blood which they believe
is not only from the House of David but also from the lineage of Jesus who they claim had a wife and
children *end* The  Satanic bloodline was instilled with the direct seed of Satan so that they would not
only carry Christ’s blood--but also the blood of his "brother" Lucifer *end* </p>

One of the bloodlines goes back to Babylon and are descendent from Nimrod *end* Down through the years
the occult world has remained hidden from the history books *end* Publishing and education have been
controlled privileges *end* They have ruled behind the scenes *end* The Mystery Religions each had their secret



councils which ruled them and these councils themselves came under the guidance of a secret
supreme Grand Council or Governing Body *end* The Mystery Religions in turn ruled the masses and the
political leaders *end* When I first began investigating the Illuminati a clear picture developed that the
history books were doctored and that great power was concentrated in the hands of oligarchies around
the world *end* But who were these powerful people *end* I have been repeatedly asked "If there is a
conspiracy who are  the conspirators?" That is what this book is about *end* The history books  are full of
information about the elites and the masses *end* Interestingly upon very close scrutiny and examination
the investigator finds that the elite have perpetuated their power for centuries and have worked hand
in glove with other elites to control the masses *end*
When seen in better light wars between kings no longer appear as wars between elite factions but
contrived wars to control the masses by their greedy elite masters *end* But who are these people *end* The
answer may not be the answer some might expect because power comes in many shapes and sizes *end* Power doesn’t have to have high visibility to be active *end* In fact due to the evil dark nature of these evil
bloodlines they have traditionally tried to remain secret *end* I am indebted to people who have stepped out
of the generational Satanic bloodlines of the Illuminati and who have given their lives to Christ for
many of the tips which got my investigations on the right track *end* This book tells what many witnesses
of generational Satanism would like to tell but are too intimidated to tell *end* Witnesses like Tom Collins
and John Todd and David Hill have tried to testify what they themselves saw--they each were
destroyed *end* But the truth will not die with Tom Collins or David Hill *end* The truth did not go out of
fashion just because John Todd was framed and dishonored by the Illuminati’s henchmen *end* Several
people from different places have confirmed that there are  Illuminati bloodlines *end* Further several
ex-Illuminati people have confirmed  my list of  families *end*
It is possible that my list is off on a name or two but if it might be off it can not be off much if any *end* I
believe the facts speak for themselves *end* As you study these bloodlines you will also see how powerful
they are *end* David Hill who was investigating the Illuminati lost his life because he had been close to
the inside as a high ranking Freemason who worked for the Mafia *end*
I received David Hill’s research manuscript two years after I had begun reporting on the  families *end* David Hill had done what I had originally done *end* He had asked questions and began to dig into who
pulled the strings in this country *end* Both David and I discovered the names of some of the more obvious
powerful families *end* For instance in David’s notes he writes "Yes it is a fact the Mellons Carnegies
Rothschilds Rockefellers Dukes Astors Dorrances Reynoldses Stilimans Bakers Pynes Cuilmans
Watsons Tukes Kleinworts DuPonts Warburgs Phippses Graces Guggenheims Milners Drexels
Winthrops Vanderbilts Whitneys Harknesses and other super rich Illuminated families generally get
along quite well with Communists who supposedly want to take away the wealth of these men and
give it to the people *end*
However this is only double talk designed to bolster the superstructure of delusion that Communists
are the enemies of all Capitalists *end* But Communists like the super rich families are not the enemies of
MONOPOLY CAPITALISM they are the foes of FREE ENTERPRISE." Untitled manuscript of
David Hill  p *end*  *end*
My research had already entered another dimension beyond David Hill’s because people trying to
escape being part of the Illuminati had given me the  family names *end* But each round of validation I
have received is a pleasant encouragement that others have seen the same things *end* It was a pleasant
surprise to see that this researcher had singled out some of  the same families as I had *end* Some of the
allied families if not all of  them probably have intermarried somewhere with one of these bloodlines *end*
Because this book is a collection of things which I have written over  the years allow me to review
what was written *end* In  I first self-published my Be Wise As Serpents manuscript which exposed
the top  families *end* In  I began my newsletter to continue exposing the Illuminati and came out
with some monographs exposing the Monarch Mind Control program and  the Illuminati
Plans/methods to create earthquakes *end* From the mid-Dec *end* ‘ newsletter up to the most recent ones in



 I have ran feature articles exposing the different top  families *end* This book is a collection of
things I Fritz Springmeier wrote between  and  about the  top  families *end*
 · PREVIEW OF VOL *end*
Besides feature articles about the top  families I have also written articles about the Illuminati in
general *end* When I went to assemble what I had written on the  families I realized that much of what
I’d said was in the content of articles about the Illuminati in general *end* I made the decision to use the
approximately  pages I’d written specifically about the  families as Book # and what I had
written in general about the families which was also  plus pages as Book # *end* Volume two will
explain how the Illuminati control the world and what some of their beliefs are and about their secret
and semi-secret organizations *end*
The two books will provide perhaps the most indepth complete picture  of the  top Illuminati
families that has been done to date *end* In fact I know of no other book which is devoted to exposing the
top  Illuminati families *end* In Volume two you will read about Illuminati life Illuminati control and
Illuminati organizations including the ACL the Bohemian Grove the Cosmos Club the CFR the
Club of Rome the Council of  the Council of  which is the Grand Druid Council the Jason
Society the Jason Group the Ordo Saturis the OTO groups MI- MJ- the Mothers of Darkness
the Pilgrim Society the Prieure de Sion the Process Church the Sanhedrin the Temple of Power and
other groups *end* These two books will give the details behind what was written "the whole world lieth in
wickedness" and that the god of this world is in its full reality Satan *end*
Grace and peace be with you

Bloodlines of Illuminati

Chapter  THE ASTOR FAMILY

The original founder of the Astor fortune was John Jacob Astor - *end* John Jacob Astor was
born in Walldorf Duchy of Baden Germany from a Jewish bloodline *end* The Jewish origins have been
hidden and quite a number of various ideas of the Astor’s heritage have been put into circulation by
the Astors *end* John Jacob Astor was a butcher in Walldorf *end* In  he came to America after a stop
over in London England *end* Although the story is that he came to America penniless--and that may be
true--he soon joined the Masonic Lodge and within - years had become the Master of the Holland
Lodge No *end*  in N.Y *end* City *end* This Holland Lodge is a prominent lodge in that many of its members
have good connections to the Illuminati elite *end* An example of just one Lodge # member is Archibald
Russell  -  whose father was President of a real hotbed of Illuminati action for many years
The Royal Society of Edinburgh *end*
By  Astor was a master of masonic lodge# *end* This is rather interesting considering Astor could
not speak Englishwhen he arrived in America and supposedly was very poor *end* John Jacob Astor was
always very famous for being coldhearted anti-social “a man who didn’t have charm wit or grace.”
This quote comes even from a relative of the DuPont family who wrote a sympathetic Biography
entitled The Astor Family *end* If this man lacked social graces and was so cold and was so poor
during his first years in the U.S *end* why did he rise to such prominence in Freemasonry *end* Certainly not
because of his social graces *end* For instance one time later in life at a meal given for elites when his
hands got dirty at the table he reached over and used the shirt of the man beside him to wipe
his hands *end* The original financial break came by carrying out a series of shady and crooked real estate
deals in the N.Y *end* city area *end*
The next breakcame when two men who are now known to have been in the Illuminati gave John
Jacob Astor a special government privilege *end* The two men were Pres *end* Jefferson and Secretary
Gallatin--both Illuminati members *end* The United States government had placed an embargo on all U.S *end* ships from sailing with goods in  *end* But Astor got special permission from these two men for his
ship to sail with its cargo *end* His ship sailed and made close to a  profit in that day’s money *end* Astor strangely profited greatly from the War of  which crippled almost all the other American
shippers *end* Astor also worked together with George Clinton another member of the Illuminati on
land deals *end* Even at that period in history British intelligence worked for the Committee of  and
for the Thirteen Top Families it is interesting then that John Coleman who had access as an
intelligence agent to secret documents discovered that the original John Jacob Astor was also a
British secret agent *end* The Thirteen Families have very intimate roles with the American and British
intelligence cults *end*
Prior to  John Jacob Astorentered into the fur trade and remained the biggest player in the fur
tradeuntil he got out of it in  *end* Over the years he had managed to build up a monopoly *end* How he
managed to push everyone else out is a good question *end*
Bear in mind white people had been trapping furs in the New World for several centuries and the
Indians for who knows how long *end* Then this guy Astor comes along and in a few years totally owns



the whole industry *end* Again this could only have happened because the occult power of this Astor
family gave them the right *end* Obviously others in the Committee of  had to step aside if his
position in the hierarchy had not given Astor the right believe me the other families that originally
controlled the fur trade would have gotten rid of Astor *end* One result of his fur company was
that Astoria OR was created *end* Today perhaps in honor of the family that originally took interest in it
Astoria is a real hot-bed for the secret Satanic covens in Oregon *end* John Jacob Astor did have a few
helpful connections *end* Three of his relatives were captains on clipper ships *end* He had connections in
London to the Backhouse family *end* He married a Todd a family frequently associated with Satanism *end* His wife a Todd was also connected to the influential Brevoort family *end* And finally for some reason
John Jacob Astor was also on good relations with the politicians of the day perhaps because most of
them were Freemasons too *end*
For a few years John Jacob Astor had participated in the opium trade but in -he publicly quit
running opium to China *end* John Coleman in his good book The  Conspirator’s Hierarchy  The  Story
of  the Committee of  p *end*  notes “John Jacob Astor made a hugh fortune out of the China
opium trade ... *end* it was the Committee of  who chose who would be allowed to participate in the
fabulously lucrative China opium trade through its monopolistic BEIC and the beneficiaries of their
largess remained forever wedded to the Committee of .” Interestingly another Top  family the
Russells was also one of the lucky ones to get a slice of the China opium trade *end* It is clear
repeatedly from history that Astor was privy to inside information in the government and maintained
his own courier system *end* John Jacob Astor bought up large amounts of land in NY which land greatly
increased in value *end* The Financial Panic of  allowed him to foreclose on a large number of
mortgages *end* John Jacob Astor’s wealth continued to skyrocket *end* As one biography said “When it came
to a question of principle versus profit Astor was a practical man.” Put simply he had no scruples *end* Astor had a reputation for being a ruthless landlord *end* He also had the reputation of not paying his
legitimate debts *end* Astor became a banker and sat on the board of  directors of the new national bank
that Hamilton created for the U.S *end* government called the Bank of the United States *end* Astor owned a
large block of the stock of the Bank of the United States *end* Astor also was fairly active
during his life as a Freemason holding several more key positions in the secret lodge life *end* John Jacob
was the richest man in the United States *end* Note this reference *end* Meyers Gustavus *end* History of the Great
American Fortunes *end* London Stationers Hall  p *end*  said “Statistics issued in
 of manufacturers in the United States showed a total gross amount of  invested *end* Astor’s wealth then was one-fifteenth of the whole amount invested throughout the territory of the
United States...” Is having / of all of what American money is invested not rich *end* John Jacob
Astor’s descendents had a penchant for secrecy and set up things to rule from behind the scenes *end* In
contrast to some of the other top families the Astors perferred not to sit on boards of corporations
they controlled *end* In  a real estate expert calculated the Astors owned / of New York
City real estate *end* After making their fortune while residing in the New York area the Astors by and
large have all gone to England *end* They still wield great financial power in the United States through
proxies *end* Forum Magazine Nov *end*  commented that authorities estimated the Astors were
worth  but that that figure had to be an underestimate *end* Today my estimate of the Astors is
that they are worth about  billion dollars *end* One of the many foundations that the Astors created was
the Vincent Astor Foundation which is controlled from England by the Astors and has in the
range of  million tax exempt dollars *end* The Vincent Astor Foundation has typically given to
Catholic and Episcoplian needs among other things *end* They also give money to agencies opposed to
private ownership of guns *end* They give money to NY’s public library *end* Imagine how much influence
that gives them when the library is receiving regular help for general support *end* A  Foundation
Directory stated that the V *end* Astor foundation had its present emphasis on preventing juvenile
delinquency *end* Why don’t I trust the Astor’s in helping out with law enforcement *end* The William
Waldorf Foundation states that its purpose is ‘Promotion of mutual understanding and the diffusion of
knowledge and culture among the United States and the dominions colonies and countries of the
British Commonwealth.’ This sounds very similar to the public statement of purpose that the secretive
Pilgrim Soc *end* has given out to those who need something about them *end* Assets for this foundation are a
mere  *end* Vincent Astor now deceased was a member of  private clubs To give an idea of
how much power just one of the many Astor men wield some of the businesses Vincent was involved



include

director- American Express Company  Atlantic Fruit and Sugar Co *end*  Chase Manhattan Bank of the Rockefellers
 City and Suburban Homes Co *end*  Classical Cinematograph Corporation
 Cuban-Dominican Sugar Co *end*  Great Northern Railroad
 Ill *end* Central Railroad

 NY County Trust Co *end*  Weekly Publications Inc *end*  Western Union Telegraph trustee NY

involved in the spread of the evolution theory *end*
Just like the Rothschilds DuPonts and Rockefellers the Astors always set one of their Astor males
as the head of the entire family *end* This headship is passed down as a birthright within the different
branches of the family just as any King passes on his throne *end* On the corner of rd St *end* and
Ave *end* the site later began the site of the Empire State Building the original Waldorf-Astoria Hotel
was built by William Waldorf et *end* al *end* The hotel opened in Mar *end*  *end* It is described as ‘the ultimate in
snob appeal.’ Later two Astor cousins built the Astoria another even taller elite Hotel in New York
which opened in  *end* Of course like many of the other elite famIlies the Astors have theIr Maine
property to get away and relax *end* In  John Jacob wrote a novel A Journey in Other Worlds where
he describes a society which operates on the idea of conserving energy *end* Strange how the elite likes to
promote conservation among us ‘cattle.’ In the late ’s the Illuminati began to reconfigure its
outward face *end* The higher levels started creating innocent sounding cover organizations to hide their
meetings behind *end* In  the Astors contributed toward the creation of the Pilgrim Society which
was the cover organization for Amer *end* & Brit *end* ° Princes of the Illuminati *end* I believe at least five Astors
are now members of the Pilgrim Society *end* The Pilgrims had recently included David Astor John Jacob
Astor  and William Waldorf Astor rd *end* And during the s Baron Astor of Hever was the
President of the London branch of the Pilgrims *end* This implies that Astor of Hever was at least the
next level up in the chain of command *end*
The Astors also have been veryprominent in the Group’ which is Britian’s equivalent to the Skull &
BonesSoc *end* In Britain the Astor along with about  other families dominate the Group just as
certain families like the Whitneys in the U.S *end* help dominate the Order of Skull & Bones *end* Again as
was earlier pointed out the key to understanding Satanism is the bloodlines *end* In  the muscle and
bone branches of the Illuminati   reconfigured themselves with the creation of the Round Table
groups in  *end* The Astors were the part of the financial backers behind the Round Table groups
along with Abe Bailey *end* Rhodes and Milner were key players is setting up The Society of the Elect a
supersecret top circle of Illuminati *end* Rhodes Trust in part helped by the Astor helps finance the
Rhodes Scholarship system *end* Rhodes a high ranking Freemason wanted the Masonic clap-trap as part
of these various new groups but Milner and Brett did away with the Masonic rituals and costumes
etc *end*
In  the Royal Institute of International Affairs RIIA was created *end* And the Astors were the
major financial backers of the RIIA which functions as the ° cover of the Illuminati *end* For those who
are new to this the RIIA is the British equivalent to the Council on Foreign Relations CFR which
takes a major role in the policy making process in the U.S *end* Waldorf Astoria was appointed to the
RIIA *end* Just above the CFR/RIIA are round table groups which were initially named by Cecil Rhodes
as the “Association of Helpers” *end* Cecil Rhodes set up the Rhodes Scholarships to recruit and bring top
men from several nations to Oxford to be initiated into the Illuminati and to learn about how to bring
in a One-World-Government So the initial selection into the Rhodes program--ist degree of the



Illum.- is equivalent to the initiation into the Skull & Bones *end* In the picture you see how the
Cliveden Astors were intimately connected to the Rhodes Scholars *end* Rhodes Scholars frequently went
to the Cliveden Estate *end* By looking at the genealogy chart you can see how the family in London
broke up into two powerful segments *end* One part centered around the Cleveden Estate *end* Another
group became Barons-the Astors of Hever - or the Hever Astors for short *end* William Waldorf Astor
owned the Pall Pall Mall Gazette the Observer and the Pall Mall Magazine *end* The London Times was
largely controlled by the Astors and since  they have owned this major source of British news *end* The DuPonts and the Rockefellers also have some major businesses where they too own blatant large
holdings *end* However most of the wealth of the  Top families is hidden so that the ties to who owns it
are difficult to track *end* Hoyt Ammidon has been a proxy for Vincent Astor and the other Astors *end* See
membership list of Illuminati in this newsletter *end* The Astor family also used Owen Lattimore as their
proxy for opium trade who in turn used Laura Spelman who was funded by the Institute for Pacific
Relations IPR *end*
The lPR was the group that supervised the Illuminati’s decision to allow Red China to share in the
Opium trade *end* The puppet strings behind big world events may not be seen by the public but if we
trace the origins of several big events we see the Astors helping pull strings *end* The IPR helped lay the
groundwork for the Pearl Harbor attack *end* The Astors also were behind the appeasement policy
in Europe which allowed Hitler to become a threat *end* The Astors were also involved in the temperence
movement against alcoholic drink which was begun by the Women’s Christian Temperence Union *end* The temperence movement was an elite created movement just like today we have big issues like
Aparteid which are made up by them to keep us busy *end* Joseph Kennedy and Onassis two other top
Illuminati families got rich off of  the temperence movement by bootlegging *end* So many people have
exposed the temperence movement See Occult Theocracy for just one expose of Freemasonry’s
involvement that it is not pertinent to cover it here *end*
Today’s equivalent of the temperence movement is the drug war *end* Col *end* Jack Astor one of the world’s
most powerful men was among those who went down with the Titanic *end* To his honor he didn’t have
to sacrifice his life but did *end* If he had been a scoundrel he could have chased a woman and her
children from some lifeboat *end* Many sermons have been preached on the significance of the Titanic
and I personally am beginning to feel that God laid it on the hearts of so many of his ministers to
understand that the Titanic was a judgment upon the pride of the world *end* More specifically it
was a warning to the New World Order’s elite *end* Another Illuminati invention was Communism *end* This
has been so thoroughly documented I don’t know why I have to state it here except that there are still
people who haven’t taken the time to study it out *end* James II *end* Billington’s book Fire In the Minds of
Men - a very scholarly work and Occult Theocracy are some good starting points to study this *end* The
Fabian Society was also connected to the Illuminati *end* For instance Illuminati prince Prof *end* George
Edward Gordon Catlin Pilgrim Soc *end* member was a member of the Fabian Society’s executive
committee *end* The Fabian logo is a Wolf in Sheep’s clothing! *end*
Fabians like H.G *end* Wells who wrote so eloquently on the New World Order with such books as The
New World Order A Modern Utopia The Open Conspiracy Blue Prints For A World Revolution was
a wolf in sheep clothing *end* H.G *end* Well’s made the New World Order something that sounded
advantageous to everyone a Utopia of sorts *end* That is not what it will be *end* During the ’s the Fabian
Socialists created the Political and Economic Planning group PEP *end* Mason Viscount Waldorf Astoria
was a leader of PEP *end* A confidential program that the PEP created and implemented through the
British government was later described in a book Principles of Economic Planning in  *end* The book
doesn’t explain why its cover has a ostentious Masonic square and compass displayed on its cover *end* George Berhard Shaw who was a communist and Fabian Socialist was the best friend of Lady Nancy
Astor who became the first woman Member or Parliment *end* These two spend vast amounts of time
together much more than Nancy did with her husband Waldorf who she didn’t care to be around *end* Waldorf was the Mason that was mentioned earlier who helped lead PEP *end* After Nancy Astor was
elected or selected by the elite to be the first lady MP one of the Russell ladys soon afterwards also
became an MP *end*


Communism pretends it is the enemy of the rich capItalists but both the rich elite and the communist
leaders are committed to wipe out Christianity to wipe out free trade with monopolies and to set up
an Illuminati One-World-Government *end* Do you see they have similar goals *end* A picture is included of
Waldorf and Nancy Astor’s visit to Russia during the s *end* The Astors were not treated like enemies
but like royalty *end* Can we see how the elite controlled press have deceived us *end* Do not trust our
Illuminati-controlled elite to protect us from communism they control communism *end* Besides
socialism Nancy Astor was a big supporter of Christian Science *end* Christian Science was a front for
witchcraft from Its very beginning *end* For more information on what Christian Science is about I suggest
people study Be Wise As Serpents chapter  *end* ‘The Healing Light” *end* Nancy Astor wrote The Natural
History of the Vampire and a book on the early Mason/Communist Bakunin *end* She used Grenfell
family papers *end* The Grenfell family were close friends to the Cliveden Astors *end* David Astor
The Honorable attended Bilderberger meetings in  and  *end* Alpha Lodge is the lodge in
England that is traditionally for royalty *end* There are other elite lodges too where the those of the elite
can protect themselves from rubbing shoulders with those of less social stature *end* These are the type of
masonic lodges that the Astors Join *end*
In summary an examination of the Astor family reveals their close connections with the full spectrum
of Illuminati activities ranging from Freemasonry the Illuminati itself the Pilgrim Society the Round

· THE ASTOR FAMILY REVISITED WITH INFORMATION ON THEIR CHANLER
BRANCH

THERE ARE  TOP BLOODLINES
Thirteen families or bloodlines are at the top and five of these families are the inside core of these
thirteen *end* Prior to Be Wise As Serpents the existence of thirteen top families was not known by very
many people *end* The existence of the  families had come out in Berry Smith’s book Final Notice in
the s but the names were still unknown *end* Berry Smith of Australia wrote in his book Final Notice
p *end*  “There are  families or groups heading up the World Government plan *end* These families are



portrayed as the  layers of blocks found on the strange seal on the reverse side of the U.S *end*  bill.”
In a little read article one SRA victim recently wrote that Satanism was controlled by a few families *end* Recently one of the Du Ponts was on a television show because the DuPonts were trying to kidnap
him because they didn’t like his support for the book Dope *end* Inc *end* I was able to get a copy of the book
and was overjoyed to find such an excellent book *end* My sources have been telling me that the top
Illuminati families were behind the drug trade *end* Yes Satan’s top followers are also the kingpins in
destroying humanity for profit through drug trafilcing *end*
The following families besides others or individuals from these families are mentioned in Dope Inc *end* as involved in some aspect of the drug trade the Astors Bundys DuPonts Freemans Kennedy’s
Li’s Rockefellers Rothschilds and Russells *end* It is no coincidence that nine of the Top  families
would get there names in a book which revealed the big names behind the world’s illegal narcotics
trade *end* It should be mentioned that some other prominent Illuminati families also play key roles in the
drug trade such as the Bronfmans Cabots Shaws Bacons Perkins Morgan Forbes Cisneros and
Oppenheimers *end* Where have we seen such names before *end* There are names in Dope Inc *end* that people
would do well to know the danger of such as Louis Mortimer Bloomfield Robert Vesco Francois
Genoud of Switzerland Ivan Slavkov of Bulgaria the Duke of Kent - Master of the Grand Mother
Lodge of the Scottish Rite and Jardine Matheson to mention a few *end* All our favorite
secret fraternal groups appear in Dope Inc *end* too *end* For instance the Triads P Masonry regular
Freemasonry the CIA the Order of St *end* John and the Jesuits *end* The Universal Christian Gnostic
Church’s which practices black magic has a whole chapter showing its connection to the drug trade *end* Britain’s assassination bureau Permindex which has been mentioned previously in this newsletter also
gets a chapter in the book *end* In the Be Wise As Serpents book I examine in detail only the Rothschilds
and the Russells *end* I did not present much to back up my statements about the  families *end* Further One
of the unthinkable items that most people do not want to consider is that their leaders who they have
idolized may be utterly corrupt *end* There was nothing to do but sit down and give the nitty-gritty details
if the threat from the Illuminati was to be properly understood *end* The facts would speak for themselves *end* The ideal solution for both writer and reader was for me to write up my research and for you to read it
as a series of articles *end* There is only so much a person can assimilate at once and these articles give
lots of details *end* In January of this year I began a series of articles on the top   families - families
which the top experts said nobody knew about *end* I did this with the hope of stimulating others to notice
these families and to alert a wider sector of the Body of Christ *end* The young colleague David J *end* Smith
who wrote part of the Jan *end*  article on the Illuminati was led to carry out further research
in addition to what the Jan *end*  article had *end* Most of this article’s information on the Astors then is a
result of David’s research *end*
DIFFICULTY IN DETERMINING THE FACTS *end* Most of the material put out on the Astors shows the unmistakable mark of distortion by writers and
historians giving information in line with what the Astors wanted the public to get *end* Books on the
Astors contain both believable and unbelievable material fact and fiction Some of the real facts may
remain obscured forever but that has not stopped us from getting the most accurate picture we could
reconstruct *end* The Astors do not make the task of investigating them easy *end* They have been very secret
and very deceptive since they arrived In this nation *end* John Jacob Astor the first prominent Astor was a
notorious liar “he was known on occasion to invent romantic tales for the edification of people who
annoyed hIm with questions ..... *end* Men who knew him best were therefore neither ready to discredit
completely all legends about his exploits nor to repeat them as gospel *end* The truth they suspected lay
somewhere between the two extremes.” Terrell John Upton *end* Furs by Astor *end* p *end*  *end* John Jacob’s
son insured that his father’s lies would go unchallenged by incinerating all of his personal records
business records and other papers *end*
ORIGIN OF THE FAMILY & its NAME
The Astors have come up with various origins for themselves and those for or against the family have
added more ideas *end* One strong possibility is that the Astors are descendants of the Astorga family
found in Southern Italy before the s *end* The most likely meaning of the name is that both Astorga



and Astor are variations meaning “Astarte” who is the mother of the occult *end* Her name is also
Semiramis *end* In Babylon the trinity was Nimrod the sun Semiramis the moon and Tammuz the
morning star *end* In Egypt these gods were called Osiris Isis and Horus *end* The pictures and statues Isis
and Horns were renamed by the Roman Catholic church as the Virgin Mary and the Christ-child *end*
THE FAMILY IN EUROPE
The family may have moved from Savoy to Walldorf Germany *end* Although it is not a certainty the
best explanation from the available clues indicates that Walldorf’s coven had some important
personages in the witchcraft/satanic system and that Johann Astor’s family had power *end* At that
time in Europe the Astor family had no chance to turn their occult power into success *end* The power
and class structure In Europe was rigid and gridlocked *end* The boundaries between peasant and
aristocracy were solidly in place *end* So the family looked to the New World to transmute their position
in the Satanic hierarchy into financial wealth and power *end* Johann Astor In Walldorf was only a
butcher *end* His best son John Jacob - was selected to establIsh the House of Astor in
America *end*
JOHN JACOB ASTOR GOES TO AMERICA
At age  John Jacob Astor quit helping the family butcher business went to England and then later
to America *end* Looking at the details of things and piecing the truth together it appears that his Satanic
authority was already in place because he was able to travel to England and as a german-speaking
peasant converse face to face with the Backhouse family in England *end* Of course the biographers make
it sound like John Jacob Astor left Germany for himself rather than his family *end* Michael Astor gives a
glimpse of John Jacob’s mission “He concentrated almost entirely on building a fortune on escaping
the poverty of his childhood and establishing a secure financial position for his family in America.”
Astor Michael *end* Tribal Feeling p *end*

OVERVIEW
The process of  years looks like this *end* Various Satanic families moved into the Southwest German
area in the late Medieval time period *end* Witchcraft associated with Diana was practiced In Southwest
Germany and this began to alarm various elements of the Roman Catholic church *end* The Astor family
provides leadership in the covens in the Heidelberg area *end* Witchcraft spread virtually all over
Southwest Germany *end* An examination of the old records from about  to  show that
witchcraft was being practiced throughout the area *end* I have the names of over  towns were it was
practiced in SW Germany the list derived from old German records *end* The Astors did not have
the position wealth and power that accorded their position in the late s of occult leadership *end* In
Germany England and France there was no way to climb the social ladder *end* However the New World
presented opportunities *end* The Astors sent two sons to prepare the way for John Jacob one to England
one to America and then sent John Jacob their most promising brightest son to the New World *end*
While in America the Astor family helped the Satanic elite headquartered in England to maintain its
control over America *end* Having come from Germany and also due to Satanism being secret John
Jacob Astor’s help given to pro-British-elite moves were more difficult to suspect *end* After establishing
themselves as aristocrats in America the tribe of Astors moved to England where because of their
high social position in America no one questioned the Queen bestowing titles of nobility on them *end* All along the process people with Illuminati connections opened doors for the Astors *end* At this point it
needs to be pointed out that there were ties between the following groups English royalty English
Satanism English Freemasonry and German witchcraft and the Italian Black nobility *end* Taking
the liberty I have as author of this article I am going to digress to give some examples of these
connections *end* Although on the surface this doesn’t directly pertain to the Astors it does *end* When one
paints in the bigger panorama of what was happening in the occult world and then one sees a blazing
star streak across that panorama then the real history of that blazing star is given by tracking its
voyage through that panorama *end* However the history books have intentionally hidden the significance
of so many of the players and groups that lay along the track of that blazing streak *end*
SPECIFIC GROUPS



Order of the Knights of the Helmet--This was an illuminated secret society with Sir Francis Bacon at

that is the group which has been entrusted with the plans for bringing in the New World Order of

understand John Jacob Astor IV when he writes in his book A Journey in Other Worlds “The souls of
the righteous departed were found on Saturn where to a background of weird music pulsating
hearts luminous brains and centers of spiritual activity quiver with motion.” A side comment John
Jacob Astor IV had a reputation for his insatiable sexual lust to paw women *end* One of the people we
have to investigate in relation to the Ordo Saturnus is Valentine Jeune who was John Jacob Astor’s
mentor in Walldorf Germany *end* Jeune may well have belonged to an organization such as Ordo
Saturnus *end*
JOHN JACOB ASTOR LEAVES GERMANY FOR ENGLAND & AMERICA

a special privilege that most other American businesses did not even try to compete with *end* Why *end* Dope Inc *end* doesn’t say this but I know that it is because the Committee of  decides such things
not free enterprise *end* American furs yielded % profit in those days *end* The privilege of fur trading
was a pot of gold so to speak that the Committee of  gave Astor and it could only have happened
because the Astor family in Walldorf was already part of a principal satanic bloodline *end* The Illuminati
members of the Astor family today use their influence to help those of the Illuminati in their dope

Bloodlines of Illuminati

By

Fritz Springmeier

Families in the world who are allied with the Illuminati *end*
Who and what kind of family are allied with the top  llluminati bloodlines *end* The Iliuminati seeks to
capture the occult power of powerful occult bloodlines around the world *end* They have intermarried with
American Indians to gain the spiritual power resident within the leading spiritual American Indians *end* Various Indian reservations are used for llluminati rituals *end* They have been doing this type of thing for
thousands of years

Powerful families around the world participate on different levels with the Illuminati *end* Some
participate on a business level- such as the various crime Mafia type families around the world *end* Mafia families might not subscribe to the occult philosophy but they do recognize power and
business *end* Some powerful families around the world participate simply on the level that they have
been sucked into the world’s system and are dependent upon going along with the flow of the world’s
system *end* An example of this would be the King of Nepal *end* The King of Nepal rules aver a poor Hindu
kingdom *end* The British empire has done a great job in trying to make Nepal dependent upon them *end* Nepal was given British protection their leading families were given British educations and their
leading tribe of warriers the Gurkhas have been serving as British mercenaries *end* Should the King of
Nepal break loose from his advisers and take an anti-NWO track his throne could be taken away via
revolution or invasion *end* The NWO has the capacity to arrange for the Indian Congress Party to invade
or some other destablizing factor *end* The British MI- and the American CIA have also stationed assets
agents in the country *end* However the trump card in sucking nations like Nepal in is to create conflict
like the Cold War and then apply Hegelian dialectics *end* Many nations around the world have been
forced to cosy up with the British and Americans because of the cold war *end* Secretly manufactured and
secretly controlled international conflicts are a great way to take away the independence of some of
the smaller nations *end* The King of Nepal has for many years feared invasions from either India or
China *end*
However Switzerland has been afforded the luxury of not having to take sides in the Illuminati’s
secretly created wars because the bloodlines have had such total control over Switzerland for so
many centuries *end* There is no need for Switzerland to participate in Hegelian dialectics *end*
If families are powerful but not in the Illuminati’s clique they can be destroyed such as Howard
Hugh was *end* An example of this is how the Rothschilds progressively destroyed the Romanovs the
Russian Imperial Family *end* But the Romanovs were also an occult bloodline and so the IlIuminati
secretly took children of the Imperial family to serve as breeders for the IlIuminati so that the
Illuminati could channel in the Romanov’s occult blood into their bloodlines *end*
The families that control Switzerland go back to Venice *end* Some of the Phnariot families of the
Byzantine have had enduring powerful lineages *end* The Venetian and Genoese banker/international
commerce families have produced some enduring powerful lineages *end* Families from these groups have
tended toward Satanism Gnosticism or cults that are not Christian *end* In this category we can mention
Darius Socinus of Venice *end* Note also that the Warburgs who work so closely with the Rothschilds are
descendents of Abraham del Banco an old banker in Venice *end* The Warburgs in turn are related to the
Rosenbergs of Kiev Russia *end* Some of your old aristocratic Russian occult bloodlines were the first to
financially help Hitler’s fledgling Nazi Party *end*
The powerful bloodlines diversify into different last names but some of them still have enough
visibility that they can be halfway tracked by their modern names *end* For instance the Cabot Family of



Boston are descendents of Sebastian Cabot who was born in Venice *end* Sebastian Cabot who father was
John Cabot was in turn descended from Giovanni Caboto of Genoa *end* Giovannia Caboto was a
member of a powerful family in Genoa *end* In modern times the Cabot family has been active in politics
and intelligence agencies for the NWO *end* For instance Thomas D *end* Cabot set up Radio Swan on Swan
Island for the CIA *end* Paul Cabot was a director of J.P *end* Morgan & Co *end* beside director of other
corporations that interlock with the Illuminati’s power *end*
Your ruling families in Western Europe tie back to William of Orange *end* There is a powerful arabic
connection to the Illuminati *end* Men like Sirdar Ikbal Ali Shah are very knowledgable about arab magic
and occult practices *end* Sirdar Ikball Ali Shah has written at least  books on magic and occultism *end* These families keep track of their genealogies and certain members of these occult families know the
histories of these families *end*
I believe that a history of the top thirteen llluminati families is the key to understanding history *end* Many
of the families which appear to be allied" with the top families are actually related at some point
back in time *end* Further many of the allied families are top level flunkies for the families with the real
power *end* Some people have tried to put the Rothschilds in this category but such thinking is nonsense *end* Not only do I have too many eyewitnesses who have come from the inside of the IlIuminati who say
the Rothschilds are one of the top but one can also point to how much control and wealth the
Rothschilds exercise *end* The process of history has been to increase their control and wealth *end* The overall
picture can’t be denied *end* The Rothschilds are not flunkies for some other more powerful family *end*
I believe that an investigator will do himself a favor in tracking down the ties a family has with the
top bloodlines and how that family interacts with the top families *end* This is the principle behind why
history books discuss royalty so much *end* All that I encourage is that people investigate Satan’s royalty
in order to understand how Satan’s realm- the power behind the scenes operates *end*
In the Be Wise As Serpents book I gave a good example of how Satan’s realm works behind the
scenes *end* The Illuminati control the Watchtower Society *end* The nominal head of the WT Society for
many years was their President Fred Franz *end* Yet Fred Franz had grown very old was blind and stayed
in his bed *end* Natheer Salih was supposedly Fred Franz’s bodyguard and helper but all communications
to WT President Fred Franz had to go through ’" Natheer Salih who would supposedly ask Franz
and then would come back with an answer *end* Apparently Salih may be from an Iraqi Jewish bloodline *end* He wears big rings and has expensive tastes *end* Salih was the channel through whom the llluminati could
pass their decisions for the WT onto the Governing Body and Bethel staff *end*


The Bundy Bloodline

My knowledge and research is limited *end* So much more work can be done to uncover the evil works of
darkness that collaborate to destroy the Christian faith *end* Hopefully articles like this will serve as
spotlights on the Jekylls and Hyde that ravage our land *end* And that seeing their opponents better
Christians will avoid the many secret spiritual undertows that drown so many *end* In the s one of
the most famous criminals was a serial killer named Ted Theodore R *end* Bundy *end* It is not publicly
known why he killed so many innocent victims *end* Ted Bundy told his girlfriend Elizabeth Kendall that
"the force" caused him to kill *end* Bundy’s confession to her was given after his final arrest in Florida *end* Elizabeth wrote down his confession as he gave it to her over the phone *end* Ted said "I don’t have a
split personality *end* I don’t have blackouts *end* I remember everything I’ve done *end* Like Lake Sammamish *end* We went out to Farrell’s for ice cream after eating hamburgers *end* It wasn’t like I had forgotten or
couldn’t remember but it was just over...gone...the force wasn’t pushing me any more *end* I don’t
understand it *end* The force would just consume me." Kendall Elizabeth *end* The Phantom Prince My Life
with Ted Bundy *end* Seattle Madrona Publishers  p *end* "The force" is the very term that high
level Satanists use to describe the power that they believe in which they believe can be used for
either good or evil *end* The movie Star Wars surprisingly used the Illuminati’s term "the force" which up
until that time had been reserved for esoteric use by Satanism and the occult *end* This is part of the plan



to take the occult and its goals and instill it into the public’s thinking and goals so that the conspiracy
becomes an "open conspiracy" with the general public promoting the drive toward witchcraft as the
world religion and its One-World-Government *end*
Who was Ted and why did he do what he did *end* There are a great number of unknowns about Ted *end* And although it appears to the public that the newspapers covered his crimes thoroughly often
appearances can be very deceiving *end* If Ted Bundy was reiated to the Bundy Family of the hierarchy
we could expect several things almost without doubt  *end* that his Satanic activities and any occult
connotations to the murders would be kept very secret by the police the newspapers and his family
 *end* that information about the case and Ted Bundy would be closely contained *end* Interestingly when I
recently went to research Ted Bundy every copy all four of them of the book Ted Bundy
Conversations with a Killer by Stephen G *end* Michaud had been stolen from the Portland Central
Library *end* One of the other books on him was also missing and the other was overdue *end* The University
library which is on a different library network was just as bad *end* I did my research across the border in
Washington state *end* Another category of books that is consistently stolen I have been told by the library
staff are books on Freemasonry *end* Consequently the Portland Central Library has a policy that
interlibrary loan books on Freemasonry cannot be taken out of the library even though the lending
library doesn’t mind if they are checked out *end* Another example of how books relating to Satanism or
the Satanic conspiracy become rare is when I checked the Thurston Co *end* WA library’s computerized
system for Anton LeVey’s Satanic Bible *end* Of the system’s  copies  were lost I assume stolen
one was listed "trace" and three were being held by the libraries that is they were not out on the
shelves *end*
Before proceeding any further let me categorically state that I haven’t found anything that ties Ted
Bundy in with the top Satanic family of the Bundys nor have I found anything that disproves it
either *end* I don’t know either way *end* Still there are some interesting items about Theodore Bundy *end* Perhaps someone else will be motivated do the genealogy work and save me the work *end* Ted was a
law student *end* One of the schools he studied law at was University of Puget Sound WA *end* A major
reason he did so poorly in law school was the immense stress that took place in his life in connection
to the time and effort he put into murdering beautiful women *end* Yet his poor academic performances
were no barrier to his political success *end* Ted does have a number of items that seem suspicious *end* First
Ted drove all the way from Washington state to Miami FL to take part in Nelson Rockefeller’s
campaign *end* He was a big Rockefeller fan *end* Ted was appointed Assistant Chairman of the Washington
State Republican Central Committee Ted travelled in elite social circles and was preparing for a
campaign for Ted to run for State Governor *end* For instance in  he was part of the Republican State
Committee *end* He may have been on this committee in other years too *end* Ironically Ted Bundy had
served briefly on the Seattle Crime Commission on a Study of White Collar Crime *end* For whatever
reasons-whether it be elite connections or his winning personality it is certain that he had a big
political career in front of him as a young person if he had not blown things *end* Second almost all the
serial killers have had connections to Satanism and in every case the media and the police have
suppressed or greatly downplayed their connections to Freemasonry and Satanism *end* For instance
Charles Manson Freemason O.T.O *end* & Satanism Sam of Sam Berkowitz O.T.O *end* & Satanism Jack
the Ripper Freemason and Henry Lee Lucas Satanism *end* Could it be that Ted Bundy had a Satanic
side to him *end* I haven’t seen anything that shows that he wasn’t a Satanist *end* He did join the Mormon
church during the middle of time period of years when he was murdering innocent women but his
motive for joining certainly had nothing to do with sincerely serving God *end*
I have learned that Ted had an interest in Astrology *end* Perhaps the closest person to Ted Bundy his
longtime girlfriend Elizabeth Kendall wrote in her book The Phantom Prince My Life with Ted
Bundy that she didn’t know why he brutally killed so many women *end* She was aware that he liked
bondage-type sexual arrangements *end* But the inner workings of Ted’s mind were a mystery to her *end* And
Ted was capable of some of the biggest lying and yet coming across totally honest *end* This type of lying
goes on everyday by the Illuminati members who as a habit make boldface lies to the public *end* Ted
Bundy was adopted by his father Johnnie Bundy who was a dentist in the northwest area of
Washington State *end* What is this main branch of Bundy’s that we are speculating that Ted’s father



might or might not be tied to *end* The original Bundy family came to the New World before  to
Boston MS *end* A few years later they moved to Taunton MS *end* A large branch of these Bundys went to
Connecticut and later a few went on to New York *end* Another group of colonial American Bundys were
in North Carolina *end* The particular members of the Bundy family that are prominent in the New World
Order today are the one’s who would have inherited the position of authority over the family if
Satanic tradition had been followed *end* The Bundy family was an old American family that was part of
the Eastern establishment but with only a few exceptions like Congressman Solomon Bundy in the
early  century the family has only come into the public’s eye during the twentieth century *end* This
family also surfaces in not so prominent places too *end* Two of the key early Watchtower Society leaders
were Bundys *end* These were Walter H *end* Bundy who went with Charles Taze Russell to Great Britain on
his May -  trip and Edwin Bundy who worked at the Bethel Headquarter at the turn of the
century and travelled around the U.S *end* for the Watchtower Society from  to  *end* The following
is my own Who’s Who of the Bundy Illuminati family *end* After this list introducing our cast of
characters this article will get back to discussing the Bundys *end*

WHAT IS SO POWERFUL ABOUT THE BUNDYS *end*
Most Americans would not recognize the Bundy family as a powerful elite family *end* However during
recent history two Bundy brothers held the key positions that controlled most of the information that
was fed to U.S *end* Presidents during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations *end* When Johnson took over
after J.F *end* Kennedy was assassinated McGeorge Bundy was in the key position as Nat *end* Sec *end* Advisor to
determine what the President did and didn’t hear *end* His brother was in a key State Dept *end* position *end* Both
Bundy brothers were also fraternal brothers of the Illuminati Order of the Skull and Bones *end* Interestingly Jonas Mills Bundy - was a key advisor to President Grant President
Garfield and President Chester A *end* Arthur *end* McGeorge Bundy and his brother William P *end* Bundy have
held important CFR and important Bilderberger positions *end* This in itself makes it clear that the
position and power of these two men is extensive *end* McGeorge Bundy sat on MJ- which is the
council of wise men that rules the United States *end* See Be Wise As Serpents chptr *end*  *end* for an
explanation about what MJ- is and documentation *end* United States has been the most powerful
nation overall on the earth so without a doubt McGeorge has had both great public-known and great
secret power *end* The three most prominent Bundys to write about are Harvey Hollister Bundy Sr *end* William P *end* Bundy and McGeorge Bundy *end* We will now take a look at these three along with Eric
Bundy who was given a key position in a sinister plot to steal all wealth and power of Howard
Hughes *end* and Harry W *end* Bundy who was a chief adept of one branch of the Illuminati *end*
HARVEY HOLLISTER BUNDY SR *end*
His grandfather was a lawyer and a Congressman and his father was a lawyer *end* Harvey also became a
lawyer *end* But he didn’t stop there *end* Harvey was initiated in the Skull & Bones in  *end* After his law
degree he did some world travelling *end* Then in  he began working for Justice Wendall Holmes *end* Later in  Alger Hiss CFR also began working for Justice Holmes *end* Hiss was a communist spy
and later a key player during F.D *end* Roosevelt’s reign *end* Harvey’s son William P *end* narrowly missed
having his career ruined because William had financially helped Alger Hiss *end* Harvey had five
children *end* Three of these had ties to the Skull and Bones Order also *end*
Harvey became the Ass *end* Secretary of State n July  until Mar *end*  under Henry Lewis
Stimson *end* Secretary of State H.L *end* Stimson was also a Skull & Bones member init *end*  Harvey’s son
McGeorge would co-author a book with Stimson entitled On Active Service in Peace and War in
 *end* Harvey was special legal assistant to the U.S *end* Secretary of the Treasury *end* Harvey became the
Special Assistant to the Secretary of War during W.W *end* II *end* He travelled with the Sec *end* of War overseas
numerous times *end* It is often said f you want to know where the real power lies look at a man ‘s



advisors *end* Here we see Harvey giving advice to the US *end* secretary of and Bones pp *end* - where be
give *end* various reasons why Covington & Burling are highly suspected of left-wing activity *end* William
began his War during the United States’ largest military challenge in history *end* Harvey was one of the
most key figures n the supervision of the Manhattan Project developing the Atom bomb *end* He was the
key Pentagon man *end* He did liaison work between the War Dept *end* and Office of Scientific Research and
Development *end* In  Harvey took over the Carnegie Endowment for Peace from John Foster
Dulles *end* The Carnegie Endowment for Peace has been a major vehicle for the Illuminati to finance tax
free various projects *end* In  for instance the Carnegie Endowment for Peace spent over  million
and had assets of  million *end* The stated object of the foundation is "to promote international peace."
This is the type of peace that President George Bush told the United Nations that the world needed *end* Skull and Bones member George Bush informed the U.N *end* that a One-World-Government peace was
needed by the world *end* Harvey got the job at Carnegie because Alger Hiss had been convicted of
perjury *end* John Foster Dulles was on record recommending Alger Hiss to replace himself *end* See Eleanor
Allen *end* and John Foster Dulles and Their Family Network by Leonard Mosley p *end*  *end* The various
men who run the various Carnegie Foundations work with the Rockefellers *end*


WILLIAM P *end* BUNDY

William P *end* Bundy started out his career n  working for Covington & Burling which is a firm
that represents many of the Illuminati in Washington D.C *end* Covington & Burling appears to have
been a conduit for the Iliuminati to create a left-wing political movement in the US *end* Read Antony
Sutton’s book America’s Secret Establishment An Introduction to the Order of Skull career working
for the CIA at this time  and in  he quit Covington & Burling to begin openly working for
the CIA as an analyst and then as assistant to the deputy director of the CIA *end* His job as assistant
required him to get Atomic Energy Clearance *end* In  Joe McCarthy had caught onto the New
World Order *end* Although the history books and papers report that he was "commie" hunting If one
reads Joe McCarthy’s own words it is clear be was gunning for the New World Order *end* Senator Joe
McCarthy subpoenaed William Bundy to testify *end* The Senator knew he could expose a great deal if
William P *end* Bundy was questioned eyen if he might try to lie *end* The calling card to get the subpoena
was the fact that William had donated at least  to help communist spy Hiss defend himself *end* Hiss’s brother Donald worked for Covington & Burling when William was there and Alger had
worked at the firm William’s Dad had worked at *end* McCarthy sent down many subpoenas but Allen
Dulles who was part of the llluminati and the CIA director ignored the subpoenas and eventually
was able to get William P *end* out of the country so that he would not have to face McCarthy’s questions *end* The State Dept *end* was going to arrest William P *end* at the dock as he was trying to escape on the Queen
Mary but Alien Dulles was able to get the State Dept *end* to call off the arrest and William P *end* Bundy
sailed *end* McCarthy wrote Allen Dulles "I note your refusal to give us any answers to our questions *end* Your insistence is very revealing *end*
It would seem that the last man in the world who would try to protect and hide the facts about one of
his top officer’s Bundy association with and contributions to a convicted traitor would be the head
of the CIA *end* I think it necessary for me to call your attention to the tremendous damage you thereby do
to this organization *end* That the matter cannot and will not rest here is of course obvious.’ A
Biogranhy of Eleanor *end* Allen *end* and John Foster Dulles and their family network by Leonard Mosley
p *end* Lou Russell who was an important figure in the House Un-American Activities Committee
HUAC was part of the Illuminati power structure *end* This is something one wouldn’t expect *end* It appears
like some of the men McCarthy thought were on his side weren’t *end* While the Hiss/Bundy affair led to
McCarthy a genuine patriot being killed and discredited someone else who was a socialist and
lackey of the CFR was given wide publicity as an anti-communist hero from what happened to Hiss *end* Funny how the credit is distributed by the establishment media *end* This socialist was Richard Nixon
CFR *end* He was given false credit for convicting Hiss CFR to build a false public image as an anti-
communist crusader *end* Nixon did not do the footwork etc *end* to get Hiss convicted contrary to the false
image the establishment newspapers and history books give *end* Later protected by his "anti-communist"
mask Nixon would recognize Red China among many other pro-communist NWO acts *end* By trying to



subject a member of one of the top  Illuminati families to Congressional questioning McCarthy
had signed his death warrant *end* It was not long before the Illuminati killed McCarthy *end* And they have
dragged this great patriot’s name through the mud *end* Skull and Bones George Bush was still taking pot
shots at Joe McCarthy during the  Presidential campaign *end* William P *end* Bundy commented on the
help Allen Dulles gave him throughout the Hiss affair with the following words "I guess there was an
element of tribal loyalty in the way Allen handled this that he knew me he knew my brother a sort
of fellow feeling-a feeling for the comradeship of the CIA but also a tribal feeling toward a set of
people who were in law firms entered government when the need was felt could be invited back to
the house." Yes that set of people is called the Illuminati *end* In  William P *end* Bundy while still with
the CIA was placed as the Staff Director of the mew Presidential Commission on National Goals *end* If
national goals are seriously being set then that implies that something is happening above and
beyond the american people voting at the voting booths congressmen voting at the Capital and the
market place simply functioning *end* Indeed there is a guiding hand behind events which is taking us
down a preplanned route to achieve Illuminati goals *end* Bundy’s Commission on National Goals set
down goals that are Hegelian philosophy *end* The goals state that the individual has a duty to advance the
will of the state and that the state "is to stimulate changes of attitude .. *end* The American citizen in the
years ahead ought to devote a larger portion of his time and energy directly to solution of the nation’s
problems...many ways are open for citizens to participate in the attainment of national goals."
America’s Secret Establishment *end* p *end*


ERIC BUNDY

The Illuminati uses what is called Hegelian philosophy *end* A thesis is set up *end* An antithesis the opposite
of the thesis is then set up and then out of the conflict of the two comes the synthesis *end* Hegelian
philosophy is really a fancy term for what the Illuminati were doing before the term was invented *end* To
bring this all down to street terms the Illuminati’s Mafia yes the Illuminati created and runs the
Mafia would send businessmen a letter demanding money and signed with the imprint of a black
hand *end* This was the thesis *end* If the demand wasn’t met then the business would be burned or the
businessman hurt *end* Then the Mafia would introduce themselves as potential protectors for the
businessman from the black hand extortioners themselves *end* This is the antithesis *end* And when the
businessman begins paying the Mafia for protection that is the synthesis *end* The llluminati are doing this
tactic all over the world and it certainly has almost everyone fooled *end* Mafia strongman Sam Giancana
birth name Momo Salvatore Guingano had a girlfriend Judith Exner that J.F *end* Kennedy a member of
one of the top  Illuminati families spent regular time with sexually *end* Giancana also had a friend
named Robert Mayheu who worked under Stavros Niarchos of the Onassis family *end* Stavros Niarchos
is a Bilderberger and a nephew of Aristotle Onassis *end* The Onassis family - of the top  llluminati
families runs the Mafia *end* Robert Mayheu worked for Giancana and the CIA *end* Why was a CIA agent
willing to help Giancana?-weil as I indicated in other places the CIA is run by the top Illuminati
families and so is the Mafia *end* This CIA agent or Mafia man or Illuminati henchman whatever you
want to call Robert Mayheu shows up in the details of the Kennedy Assassination and the kidnapping
of billionaire Howard Hughes *end* Robert Mayheu and other men like him had infiltrated Howard
Hughes’ organization prior to the kidnapping *end* In Mar *end*  a wing or branch of the Illuminati under
Onassis commonly known as the mob or mafia kidnapped the upstart billionaire and genius Howard
Hughes *end* Now do you see what happens to competition to the Illuminati Top  families *end* Either you
join the them or you are destroyed *end* Satan must keep his organization intact *end* From the best inside
information I have obtained concerning this area of Illuminati activity apparentiy two -who were
look-alike *end* to Howard Hughes were used *end* The reason two were used will be explained *end* First because
the "Howard Hughes’ actually L Wayne Rector who on rare occasions showed himself was a fake
the Iliuminati wanted to keep him out of the public eye as much as possible so it made sense to have
another double *end* The natural story was that because Howard Hughes was so reclusive he had hired
Hollywood actor Brooks Randall to be his double to keep newsmen and other snoops from following
him *end* When Howard Hughes L *end* Wayne Rector would go out then the decoy Brooks Randall would
be employed to keep photographers process servers and private detectors away from the Illuminati’s



real "Howard Hughes" L *end* Wayne Rector *end* It was Robert Mayheu that hired Brooks Randall *end* And
working with Mayheu and somewhat over Robert Mayheu was Eric Bundy was given oversight of the
day to day operations involving the control of their prisoner Howard Hughes who most likely died in
 and whose public death was  *end* For those wanting an official "paper trail" see Senate Report
No *end* - entitled "Alleged Assassination Plots involving Foreign Leaders" // p *end*  where
Mayheu’s role is talked about in the death of Onassis *end* One of Mayheu’s top men was Lou Russell
who- besides working for Mayheu the CIA the Onassis family-was the person who bandied the
security and investigative needs of the Republican National Committee RNC and Russell was with
the company that provided security for the Watergate complex when it burgiared *end* The Russell family
is a top  family *end* The Russell family will of course have its own turn to have an article about them in
this newsletter *end* It is Lou Russell who helped Nixon get Hiss convicted *end* Was McCarthy and Hiss
used *end* It appears so *end* John Smith now puts out the theory contained in his book Alger Hiss The True
Story which claims Alger Hiss was framed *end* So we have come full circle *end* The communist agent that
almost ruined William P *end* Bundy’s career because Bundy was Alger Hiss’s and Donald Hiss’s friend
is now exonerated by a book written by an establishment researcher *end*


MCGEORGE BUNDY

Antony C *end* Sutton does an excellent iob in his book on the Skull & Bones Order in describing how
McGeorge Bundy received preferential treatment all through his life *end* Consistently McGeorge Bundy
got jobs for which there were thousands of better candidates *end* McGeorge Bundy went to Yale where
he was initiated into the Skull & Bones in  *end* McGeorge then went to Harvard *end* After this
McGeorge joined the army as a private *end* Very few privates ever achieve the rate of promotion that
McGeorge received *end* Within a year after joining as a private McGeorge was promoted to captain *end* Not
only was he made a captain he was placed on staff to plan the logistics and other details of the
invasion of Sicily and the Normandy Invasion *end* That is honestly fantastic *end* How can a greenhorn
without experience have the experience to know how much supplies etc *end* are needed for a certain
operation *end* Bear in mind that these calculations are for battles in which the wrong combination of
supplies could mean death or defeat for a unit *end* As Sutton points out on pg *end*  "Can a -year *end* old
with no military experience undertake planning for amphibious operations *end* The answer is obviously
no even if his father The Order is in the Pentagon as an aide to the Secretary of War The Order."
After the war McGeorge continues his phenomenal climb from job to bigger job often with no
credentials *end*  *end* He becomes assistant to the Secretary of War and co-authors a book with Stimson *end*
Then McGeorge without any experience or credentials in economics becomes a consultant to the
Economic Cooperation Administration *end* Then he becomes foreign policy analyst for Presidential
candidate Thomas Dewey *end* Christians may recognize from the instruction that the Bible gives that
pride warps our abilities to accurately see *end* How much pride has been installed in men like McGeorge
that they feel comfortable to hop from one unqualified position to another and to make weighty
decisions *end*
- Bundy was invited to Harvard University to teach as an assistant professor and in four years is
made the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard *end* How does anyone become Dean of a
prestigious University department after four years of teaching *end* Not only has McGeorge been treated
as if he is an instant military genius an economic whiz now he is bead of the arts and sciences *end* Bundy becomes the National Security Advisor *end* From  to  he is the Special Assistant for
National Security Affairs to the President *end* This gives him great control over what the Presidents are
told *end* For instance on pages - Sutton quotes a conversation between McGeorge Bundy Dean
Achison Scroll & Key-another llluminati initiation point and President Kennedy recorded in a
memorandum *end* President Kennedy is lead to believe that the United States has deserted its ally of
Portugal to aid nationalists in Angola when in fact the US *end* was supporting Marxist guerrillas that is
communist guerrillas *end* In  McGeorge was appointed President of the Ford Foundation another
Illuminati foundation that is promoting their agenda *end* McGeorge brought in Harold Howe II to be
Vice *end* President a position that Howe was unqualified for except that Howe was a Skull & Bones



brother and was a team player that would help promote the New Worid Order agenda with its
Hegelian philosophy and socialism *end* Both of the Fords on the Foundation board resigned in disgust at
the way these Skull and Boners were using the Ford Foundation *end*


HARRY W *end* BUNDY

Harry W *end* Bundy was a Mason a Satanist and the chief adept ° of the Colorado part of the SRICF *end* To clarify to the reader what this all means allow me to inform you about the structures Satan has
built *end* Pure Satanism in order to function easier has set up some branches which are secret but if the
public hears about these branches they have a veneer of respectability *end* Dr *end* Wynn Westcott a famous
Satanist and the Supreme Magus of S.R.I.A *end* wrote the rare book History of The Societas
Rosicruciana in Anglia *end* IX *end* It was privately printed by these Masonic Rosicruclans on Dec *end*
and later received the Br *end* Museum Press Mark of  h *end* Within this rare book the leader of the
S.R.I.A *end* spells out the purpose of the organization to the Brotherhood "The aim of the
Society...searching out the secrets of Nature; to facilitate the study of the system of philosophy
founded upon the Cabala and the doctrines of Hermes Trismegistus ..." Hermes Trismegistus as
many of you know means "the trice greatest Hermes" who was the Egyptian scribe god who is
claimed to be the author of all magical writing *end* Hermes is credited for the grossly evil Satanic-
witchcraft rituals that the ancient Egyptians and modern Satanism continue to practice *end* For an
excellent exposé of the connections between the Egyptian Book of the Dead Masonic Rituals and
modern Satanism I suggest David Carrico’s book The Masonic Egyptian Satanic Connection *end* obtainable from Followers of Jesus Christ  Ashley Dr *end* Evansville IN  *end* As I was just
writing a number of branches of the Illuminati were created with the same pattern as the Bavarian
Illuminati and these branches sometimes refer to themselves as Illuminati-and rightly so since they
are integral part of Satanism *end* One branch has been set up within  *end*
Freemasonry called Societas Rosicruciana *end* They coil themselves Rosicruciana and Christians *end* How
they attach the aame of Christ to Satanism is beyond my imagination *end* Perhaps the "Christ
consciousness they seek justifies in their minds calling themselves "exclusively Christian." Whatever
they want to coil themselves they practice magic and Satanism *end*
A number of daughter organizations have sprung up from the S.R.I.A *end* such as the Golden Dawn the
Stella Matutina and the Ordo Templi Orientis OTO *end* The S.R.I.A *end* also worked closely with German
Illuminism and the Theosophical Society *end* In England the Societas Rosicruciana S.R *end* is named S.R *end* in Anglia in Scotland it is S.R *end* in Scotia in Greece it is S.R *end* in Graecia in Canada it is S.R *end* in
Canada and in the US *end* it is S.R *end* in Civitatibus Foederatis *end* The membership is very exclusive *end* And
my understanding that there are about a dozen US *end* lodges called "colleges" with about  members
each which lends me to guess they have an exclusive membership of about  in the United States *end* Membership in Societas Rosicruciana has included such notable Satanists such as A.L Waite Eliphas
Levi and Kenneth Mackenzie *end* It has included that Luciferian Albert Pike too *end* Within a nation the
arena are divided up into provinces each of which has a "college"-their fancy word for a satanic
lodge *end* On Apr *end*   Harry W *end* Bundy became the chief adept of the Colorado college *end* Two letters
by the Supreme Magus of all the S.R *end* groups Win *end* Wynn Wescott are photocopied so that the reader
can read for himself from the SRIA’s Supreme Magus lending magician that they are connected to
the Illuminati *end* See for yourself! *end* An interesting point in light of what I have printed in other
newsletters the Mass *end* college in  printed a book by its Supreme Magus Gould ° which
declares that the Grand Central San of the Universe is Alcyone in the Pliades *end* Shades of Alice Dailey
and C.T *end* Russell! *end* One of the most knowledgeable people to try to expose the New World Order and
the Satanic hierarchy behind it said "It remains for the student to follow evvery line of enquiry to the
point of concentration where nil threads are gathered and systematically manipulated for the eventual
destruction of Christian civilization *end* It may lend to the B’nai B’rith the Universal Israelite Alliance
India or Tibet but in any case a thorough and complete study of Rosicrucianism embracing a minute
one of Rosicruciana in Anglia and its various branches will be a great step taken in the direction of
uncovering much of the political and moral chaos of present day history of mankind." p *end*


Interesting that this expert would say this *end* The threads go buck to  Top Families and wouldn’t you
know several of their people are lenders of the S.R.I.A *end* including Harry W *end* Bundy *end* The Bundy
family has been a very powerful family in American history which has managed to keep itself out of

Bloodlines of Illuminati

By

Fritz Springmeier

THE COLLINS BLOODLINE



The next family in our series of articles on the top  Illuminati families is the Collins family The
first two have been the Astor family and the Bundy family *end* The first two articles were fairly
straightforward *end* Both the Astor and Bundy families have been written about by others and I had
more information on both families than I needed for my articles *end* In fact I left out worthwhile details
in both artides in order to keep the articles to a comfortable length *end* In this Collins article there will be
some padding." In terms of research on the Collins family from a scale from  to  I’m about at
 *end* There are some hard connections that will be presented and some soft connections *end* Joan Collins is
what I’d call a soft connection *end* She has associated with a long list of key Illuminati men and at least a
few known Satanists but this is only the barest of dues that she might have anything to do with the
Illuminati herself *end* Let me give some of the hard connections first *end*
The following is a description of a highly secret high level Satanic meeting *end* It comes via an ex-insider
who is now a Christian *end* If any other ex-hierarchy person is reading this perhaps this will trigger some
memories for you *end* This experience dates to  *end* This is a meeting that is held twice yearly and to
which the Rothschilds and all the mother families attend *end* The meeting is inside in a big room and the
Grande Mother on the throne was a Collins *end* The Collins family has been kept out of the limelight
because they have more occult power than the Rothschilds or the Rockefellers *end* To make money this
Collins family does something financially such as deal with the exchange of money *end* I’ve noticed that
numerous Collins have been Insurance Executives and although I haven’t exposed the connections
between Insurance Companies and the NWO there is a book out which shows how they most
insurance companies are connected and under the guidance of the NWO elite *end* The Grande Mother
Collins dressed in black has an ebony and gold moon shaped throne that she can automatically rotate
by pushing a pedal with her foot *end* Behind her sits the Grand Council with  members --this might be
or might not be the Grand Druid Council that you will read about further on *end* The difference between
this council in  is that it was all males while the council in  has several women on it. *end* The
Grande Mother a Collins woman was thought to be in her middle ’s at the time of this meeting she
had a deep dictatorial voice was small in stature and was very powerful *end* She was decked out on her
throne with a great deal of jewelry *end* One of the first things done was to lay before her feet small gold
bricks shaped like small bricks and made of pure gold *end* Two boys who were taken to be her sons
one of whom was Tom Collins Tom was later gunned down by the Illuminati were near her throne *end* As only the most honored and powerful dared be in the vicinity of her throne this showed that these
two Collins boys were powerful *end* The boys passed out papers which had time tables written on them
of things that were to happen *end* A great discussion was carried on about what had happened in the
world to bring in Satan’s One-World-Government during the last six months and what was prepared
to happen in the near future *end* Things that had not gone according to plan were discussed *end* The Ark of
the Covenant was discussed where it was hidden in Africa and a ritual mocking the Ark of the
Covenant was held *end*
Seven children in white were brought in from generational Satanic families and presented before
Grande Mother Collins *end* They laid prostrate in worship of her *end* She would move her scepter with a



snake up and down striking the floor to show approval of a child candidate *end* Then  other children
were sacrificed for the  approved children one for each child whose name would then be written
with a quill using the sacrificed child’s blood *end* The children were given oaths *end* The Grande Mother
rotated her throne and faced the Council of  and declared speaking in English "This is tomorrow’s
generation a chosen few." The John the Baptist of the Anti-Christ put in an appearance but the anti-
Christ at that time was not born or only a tiny baby *end* Was this BenjamIn Creme *end* The ex-insider didn’t
learn the name of this John the Baptist forerunner of the Anti-Christ *end* However the descriptions of
this occult John the Baptist do match BenjamIn Creme *end* Benjamin Creme was born in  and was
deeply into the occult and witchcraft even when he was a boy *end* See the official newsletter of Tara
Center Emergence Jan  Issue *end* He claims that in  he telepathically received a message
from his Master a member of the demonic hierarchy *end* Creme calls these master spirits simply the
hierarchy Christians know it is the demonic hierarchy *end* Because all these things are planned out well
in advance it would have been very appropriate if Creme had been at a high level planning meeting
in  *end* For more understanding on Creme’s Christ the reader is directed to read the article on the
Sufis in thIs newsletter *end* Referring back to the gold bricks laid before the Grande Mother’s throne
there are several reasons that real gold is important to the Illuminati *end* Perhaps in some other article this
newsletter will go into it all *end* There have been massive secret gold shipments out of the United States
and Russia *end* Guess who is getting it *end* In my // newsletter the names of many top Illuminati are
given *end* One that could have been included is Robert Moore Collins - *end*  who was a member of
the Pilgrims  of the modern equivalent of the Bavarian Illuminati *end* Robert M *end* Collins was a
reporter for several important newspapers and worked as an editor in the Washington and New York
offices of the Associated Press *end* He did chiefly political work for the Associated Press *end* He was the
chief newsman for Reuters Illuminati controlled press and the Associated Press for many stories
coming out of the Orient *end* Although he was born in Wash *end* D.C *end* his address as an adult became
Bournemouth England *end* He never married *end* As those who investigate the Illuminati find out the
Illuminati control the press *end* Here was a man who helped do it for them Last newsletter issue //
went into some detail about how important the Satanic Societas Rosicruciana is in relation to the
Satanic groups such as the O.T.O *end* Golden Dawn and Stella Matutina *end* The Societas Rosicruciana is
definitely a high level exclusive Illumanati organization *end* One of the New York S.R *end* officers was
James F *end* Collins ° who died Apr *end*   *end* He was with the original set of S.R *end* officers of the first
High Council of the S.R *end* in America which had oversight over all the S.R *end* colleges lodges in
America *end* His position was Presenter *end* I don’t know what that officer does *end* When the Canadians set
up a Societas Rosicruciana in Canada the High Council which had oversight over all Canada
included a Collins on its council Daniel Collins ° *end* Daniel Collins had several positions on the
council *end* The highest degree is the ° *end* If you’ve read the Jan   newsletter or Be Wise As
Serpents you have come across the Grande Druid Council This is a high level Illuminati council *end* In
Be Wise As Serpents in the second section in a chapter entitled Heresy Interlocks with Power on the
 page I gave the names of people who were on that secret Grande Druid Council in the Spring of
 *end* Each of those people are powerful witches and have a great deal of power in the world *end* Yvonne Collins was on the Grande Druid Council *end* She was a traditionalist *end* To be a traditionalist
means that she holds the view that only those people who are born to families with satanic power and
witches in their family background can be true witches Obviously the Collins family has a long
history of witchcraft if she holds this view *end* Remember that the leading Satanists feel they have
special blood the top ones feel they are gods *end* Even Grande Masters may teach their selected children
they are the god which created the children *end* This last statement makes more sense when one learns
the methods state of mind and beliefs of the Satanic hierarchy *end* Yvonne Collins would reject the
idea that just anyone can become a witch of any significance by training and practice *end* The occult
demonic power would not be strong enough for a convert to witchcraft *end* Yvonne’s occult name is
Legena which means Lucifer’s bride *end* Legena Yvonne Collins who lived la Virginia got upset with
Jerry Falwell he didn’t follow orders well enough *end* She got the Security and Exchange Commission
to investigate his church which caused the church economic hardships *end* Even mainline Christian
ministers are expected to follow directives of the Grande Druid Council which is said to operate
under the orders of the Rothschilds *end* Everyone who was high up in the Illuminati and are NOW
Christians remember Tom Collins *end* Collins was in the Illuminati but for some reason the Lord
changed his heart and he began to talk to churches about what is really going on *end* He had an itinery of



churches to speak to of which a Baptist church was one *end* He warned what was going on *end* He was
gunned down in a Grocery store parking lot and has been used as an example by the Illuminati to
anyone else who dares utter a word *end* "Remember Tom Collins" they warn people in the covens *end*
This reminds me of another incident which happened to a brother in Olympia WA the capital of
WA *end* Two weeks after Reagan was elected a beautiful Mercades pulled up to where this Christian
brother was working *end* The guy who got out was obviously rich-his suit had to be in the neighborhood
of  and his wife had fox furs around her neck *end* They said their son was going to work for the state
and they wanted to look for a home for him *end* The woman was being Independent and said "I don’t
want to go see the houses *end* I want to talk to this nice man." The houses were done by Donahue
Construction *end* The men went on to look at the houses and the woman remained behind and talked *end* This Christian is an easy talker with people *end* He struck up a conversion naturally *end* He said "I think its
great Ronald Reagan got elected he’s going to be a good president." The woman replied "We wanted
George Bush to get it." "Whose we?" the Christian asked to this rich lady who kept tossing her furs
back and forth *end* "The Illuminati" she said "We’re the enlightened ones and George Bush was trained
by us." Unfortunately the men had just returned at this point and were entering the room *end* The man
with the expensive suit was livid *end* "Shut your .... *end* mouth" he yelled *end* She huffed back Well if you
insist." He then turned to the Christian who he didn’t know and politely told him that they had failed
to find anything that suited them *end* "Thank you very much everything is secure." and handed him the
keys *end* Then he dragged the woman to the Mercedes giving her hell all the way for talking and when
they got in proceeded to physically slap her around *end* This was an extremely rare incident *end* Many of the
Satanic hierarchy live their entire lives without uttering a word to anyone anything about the hidden
Satanic side of their lives *end* As a rule they find very respectable cover lives in society--the more
respectable the better- to cover their hidden lives *end* The Satanic rituals are always memorized *end* You will
not walk into these people’s houses and find incriminating books or objects *end* Remember Ted Bundy in
last issue’s article *end* Ted was exactly the model of bow many top Illuminati are *end* They are capable of
the most horrendous things but to everyone who know them they are the most likable intelligent
normal people *end* People who knew Ted Bundy had no idea what he was doing in secret *end* The Satanic
hierarchy and their Satanism is clearly the most secret religion in the world *end* They are a priesthood
that rules the world through political leaders that they place in power *end* And because of their power
they have the ability to suppress a great deal of the publicity that could arise from their numerous
activities *end* To describe the security methods employed to keep high level Satanism secret could take
an entire book *end* Let’s just put it this way if you were a billionaire which several of the leading
Olympians King Illuminati are what kind of security could you afford *end* And what kind of clout
would you have with national governments and police forces to get even governments to provide
security for you *end* Remember these people own the press and the media *end*
They will kill or discredit anyone who exposes them *end* Don’t be surprised if both of these happen to
me the author *end* Just know this--they can kill the body they can not kill the soul *end* Our Christian God
reigns *end* They also control the CIA and FBI *end* See Be Wise As Serpents for more details on this *end* Many
leading FBI agents have not only been Masons *end* but many have been Satanists *end* The FBI sends out
reports which paraphrased go like this "Far more crime has been committed by zealots in the name of
God than has ever been committed in the name of Satan *end* The actual involvement of the occult in a
criminal case usually turns out to be secondary insignificant or nonexistent *end* The law enforcement
perspective on occult crime requires avoiding the paranoia that has crept into this issue *end* Unless hard
evidence is obtained and corroborated police officers should avoid being frightened into believing
that satanists are performing criminal ceremonies requiring investigation *end* An unjustified crusade
against such activity could result in wasted resources unwanted damage to reputations and disruption
of civil liberties." This type of thing is hilarious to hear from the FBI for those who know how they
have trampled on every civil liberty by investigating tens of thousands of organizations simply
because they opposed the establishment and ruined the reputations of many people- Martin Luther
King for instance *end* People who have read my book may have picked up that J *end* Edgar Hoover was a
° Mason homosexual and worked intimately with the Illuminati *end* For those who haven’t come out
of Satanism one way to explain to people how Satanic secrecy functions is to compare these Satanic
families with the Mafia families *end* Individuals in these families learn what they need to know no more *end*


The top bosses have cover jobs and give their orders orally *end* Actualy the comparison between Mafia
or Costa Nostra families and Moriah or Illuminati families is quite fitting because they tie in
organizationally and were created by the same occult stream of secret societies that Satan has been
running *end* Don’t expect to find what you are reading here about the Collins family- that they are one of
the very top illuminati families even more powerful than the Rothschilds- anywhere else *end* People are
getting the inside story for the first time *end* I am grateful for various exrinsiders giving me accounts of
secret meetings *end* Except for the testimony of eye-witnesses there is little evidence of what happens at
hierarchy meetings *end* There are numerous clues but they are rejected by most people who refuse to
accept that the Satanic hierarchy exists *end* Before the s and the space programs man had not seen
the far side of the moon *end* But that didn’t mean it wasn’t there *end* The hierarchy are professionals at
Satanism and are really pros at obtaining satanic power through ritual deeds and worldly power *end* Their activities are very secret *end* In contrast there is great deal of physical evidence from the coven
levels the lowest level that periodically surfaces-robes candies made of fat athames altars dead
animals ritual sites etc *end* The higher levels believe that the force must be balanced-one’s good deeds
mast match one’s evil deeds *end* Consequently some of the greatest philanthropists are leading Satanists *end* The lower levels are not concerned with developing power such as what Satan has they simply enjoy
being evil and in that respect are rather crude in their exercise of evil *end*
The Collins family hasn’t received much attention *end* Who do you think of when you think of the
Collins *end* Joan Collins *end* She was a beautiful Jewish Hollywood actress from England *end* Joan’s
grandmother lived at Brighton England *end* Joan mentions her father being a jew on pg *end*  of her
autobiography Joan Collins Past Imperfect *end* Her father Joe Collins and his friend Lord Lew Grade
had an acting company *end* Joe Collin’s father Will Collins and his wife a can-can dancer Henrietta
Collins were also into acting *end* In the ls she was in several horror movies and picked up the title
"Queen of the Horror Films" p *end*  *end* In  and  Joan was nude in two sexy films not her
first which were expected to do better at the box office than they did neither of the titles of these
films bear repeating *end*
One was based on a sexy book Joan’s sister wrote that was a best-seller in England *end* Joan was the first
"old" woman to be in the buff in Playboy the Dec ' Playboy *end* The issue is a collector’s item *end* In her
s she was still posing in the buff *end* Which according to her autobiography she feels comfortable
doing *end* I wonder if being exceptionaly beautiful and a sex idol for millions makes it easier to pose
nude *end* For those who watch Dynasty you’li likely remember her *end* For those who watched Hansel and
Gretel Joan was the witch *end* She was the woman in film The Devil Within Her *end* In Dec *end*  Joan was
asked to be the mistress of ceremonies at Prince Albert Hall before the Queen and His Royal
Highness Prince Phillips *end* Besides knowing that she is into astrology after looking at her
autobiography I don’t pick up a hint of any religiousness *end* Besides her amazing beauty her lack of
morals made her a perfect fit for Hollywood *end* Among her many friends she had Sammy Davis Jr *end* p *end*  and Jayne Mansfield as friends or acquaintances both of whom are publicly known to he
Satanists *end* She rubbed shoulders with Henry Kissinger p *end* of Autobio *end* Joan Collins vacationed in
the winter at St *end* Moritz which is an exclusive ski resort of the international set where Joan rubbed
shoulders with Niarchos and Aristotle Onassis *end* These - are Kings within the Illuminati *end* Joan Collins
spent time with Edgar Bronfman *end* The Bronfman family are the Jewish Illuminati family that runs
Canada *end* p *end* - Joan Collins may not he part of the Illuminati Collins family but if she isn’t she
has at least associated with some of the top Illuminati *end* Joan was married several times but obviously
preferred her maiden name *end* Another famous Collins is Michael Collins who was one of the three
astronauts on the Apollo II *end* Apollo  was the first officially announced visit by man to the moon *end* For those who have read Be Wise As Serpents you are aware that the first flag on the moon was the
Scottish Rite’s flag *end*
There are a number of very strange things about the flight and about what NASA has been doing *end* Bun Aldrin is a Freemason *end* Neil Armstrong has gone into seclusion shunning any publicity *end* As
Michael Collins puts it Nell has "dropped out and doesn’t sell the NASA program." Carrying the
Fire by Michael Collins p *end* --The title to his book is based on Greek mythology *end* The god Apollo
carried fire which is what Michael felt described Apollo  *end* What our government has been doing



with NASA flying saucers and a manned lunar base is beyond writing about in this article But the
question did naturally come to my mind could Michael Collins be related to the Illuminati Collins
family *end* Michael Collins writes about himself "Fortunately I have been a poor student all my life
and my parents concealing their disappointment seldom pushed me.’ Carrying the Fire p *end*  It
certainly seems like such a student would need some pull to get into West Point USMA *end* Michael
Collins also sits on the board of directors of the llluminati’s Rand Corporation which works with
Tavistock Institute *end* He is not even a nominal Christian as far as I can tell he states dryly that "no" he
"did not find God" when he went to the moon *end* It looked like the clues were leading in the direction
that he might be part of the elite when I can across one sentence that changed my mind *end*
Michael Collins wrote "I feel just as thankful today that I live in the United States of America as I
did before flying in space and I have no desire for this country to merge into a United States of the
World.’ p *end* of his book *end* By the way Michael Collins wrote his own book in contrast with so many
of the Christian" authors like Pat Robertson’s New World Order and some of Billy Graham’s books
which are written by others with the big name tacked on to sell it *end* If anyone could promote
internationalism One-World-Govt *end* without any suspicion it would be Michael Collins for few men
share his experience of seeing the tiny earth in the vastness of the hostile universe *end* And yet he
doesn’t he simply advocates that humans learn to cooperate to solve our problems- which we
certainly need to do *end* Michael Collins has some really interesting and in a sense inspiring things to say
about what seeing the earth from way out in space meant to his life *end* What he writes bears repeating *end* I
don’t have the space for it all but will share one idea that is novel "Seeing the earth from a distance
has changed my perception of the solar system as well *end* Ever since Copernicus’ theory that the earth
was a satellite of the sun instead of vice versa gained wide acceptance men have considered it an
irrefutable truth; yet I submit that we still cling emotionally to the pre-Copernican or Ptolemaic
notion that the earth is the center of everything *end* The sun comes up at dawn and goes down at dusk
right *end* Or as the radio commercial describes sunset "When the sun just goes away from the sky..."
Baloney *end* The sun doesn’t rise or fall it doesn’t move it just sits there and we rotate in front of it
while dusk means we have turned another  degrees and are being carried into the shadow zone *end* The sun never "goes away from the sky." It’s still there sharing the same sky with us; it’s simply that
there is a chunk of opaque earth between us and the sun which prevents our seeing it *end* Everyone
knows that but I really see it now." pp *end* - I like Michael Collins *end* What I just quoted is neat *end* After reading lots of occult garbage I really appreciate someone who isn’t into emphasizing the sun *end* If Michael were an occultist he would not have made this statement *end* In fact I think it would be
healthy for Christians to quit looking at the stars and realize how wonderful God’s green earth is *end* Praise His holy name *end* The earth is a very unique wonderful marvelous place *end* And all these people
who use their imaginations and belittie the earth because they think some other planet in another
galaxy is better should do some space travel *end* The earth is a miracle and anyone who doesn’t see God
through His creation is not thinking straight *end* Back to the question is Michael’s Collins family part of
the Illuminati Collins family *end* I have no idea but

Michael himself is not an internationalist *end* The Collins family is an old New England family *end* Early
members of it were Francis Edward and John *end* See the genealogical chart *end* Part of the Satanic branch
may live in England too *end* Like most top Illuminati families the Collins have spread al over - so that
even the West Coast has some members of this satanic bloodline *end* Part of the family is both related to
aristocracy and to witchcraft *end* For instance I have a complete list of all people accused of witchcraft
in New England in the  century which includes some Collins The  century was the first
century that British settlers mostly Puritans some of whom are also known as Pilgrims and
Congregationalists settled in New England *end* In  in Aquiday Mass *end* a Collins was accused of
witchcraft *end* In  Jane Collins was accused of witchcraft in Lynn Mass *end* And a Collins family lived
in the Salem Mass *end* area of Marblehead during the s when the witch trials occurred *end*
They were neighbors to the family accused of witchcraft *end* Interestingly some of the last names of other
people accused of witchcraft in early colonial Massachusetts include Young Bailey Carrington
Godfrey Hall Brown and Clinton *end* You will find all of these last names on people today who are
connected to the Satanic hierarchy Illuminati and Satanism *end* However the worst example of dealing



with "witchcraft" the Salem Witch trials was instigated by the Collins family to destroy Christians *end* Christians have been held accountable for something the Collins family did to Christians in Salem
Mass *end* My opinion is that the Collins family practiced witchcraft before coming to New England in
the  century *end* One ex-Illuminati member who was from the Collins bloodline stated that the
Collins family brought witchcraft from England to America *end* For the first part of the s one of the
British Collins was prominent for his books promoting Deism against Christianity *end* As an example of
some of their aristocratic ties Arthur Collin’s  volume reference work Collin’s Peerage of England
published in  was a definitive work on aristocratic peerage *end* Obviously Arthur Collins had a
great deal of clout to be able to research such a massive work on people of significance in England *end* The Collins family gave us John Collins third Governor of Rhode Island *end* John Collins was born to
the rich powerful part of the Collins family at Newport R.I *end* John Coliins - played an
important part in the creation of our Federal government and a role in one of the most remarkable
court cases Trevett vs *end* Weeden which set the precedence in court which allowed courts to declare
legislative enactments unconstitutional *end* He advocated the issuance of paper currency and a strong
central government which made him unpopular in the rural areas of Rhode Island *end* He married Mary
Avery *end* Another John Collins - born to a well-to-do Collins family was tenth governor of
Delaware - *end*
Quite a number of Collins have been well-to-do *end* The wealthiest Collins that I have discovered so far
is Matthew Garrett Collins - *end* Matthew Garrett Collins was an oil producer *end* His father was
Oliver Cromwell Collins *end* named after Oliver Cromwell *end* Oliver Cromwell was the early Mason who
was paid off by the Amsterdam jews to allow the jews back into England *end* Matthew Garrett Collins
was a Mason *end* M.G *end* Collins manufactured silk and in ten years took the operation in  from
nothing to a  million business *end* He was president of Interstate Gasoline Co *end* He worked with several
other big oil men such as Gov *end* Charles Haskell of Oklahoma *end* He was Trustee for Drew Seminary *end* He participated in the Methodist church *end* Matthew Garrett Collins oil operations and friendship with
the governor of Oklahoma are very  significant *end* Inside information indicates some type of connection
between the Collins family and Oklahoma and Tulsa is a major headquarters for Satanism in that
area *end* There are a number of buildings that the Satanists own in the Tulsa area that are used for their
operations *end* Besides Matthew Garrett Collins there have been a number of other wealthy Collinses
such as Theodore Clyde Collins Jr *end* Insur *end* co *end* exec *end* banker pres *end* of etc *end* etc *end* Arthur Fletcher
Collins real estate corp *end* exec *end* hd of some financial institutions and an financial analyst Henry
James Collins rd Insur *end* Co *end* exec *end* treasurer of several financial organizations J *end* Barclay Collins
nd oil co *end* exec *end* lawyer bd *end*  of trustee of a hospital Leroy Collins Jr *end* banker  or president
of some organizations John Roger Collins aerospace co *end* exec *end* banker economist trustee or bd *end* of
 & v.p *end* of a number of organizations John Paul Collins banker  of Rothschild’s Citicorp
Research Corp *end* plus trustee of a hospital besides holding other leading positions in a number of
other organizations *end* And finally Michael James Collins not the astronaut who has been an
investment co *end* exec plus to name a few items-- pres *end* Fidelity Union Life Ins *end* pres *end* Allianz
Investment Corp *end* pres *end* Collins Capital Dallas Trustee KERA-TV bd *end*  & v.p of the Carr P *end* Collins Foundation *end* None of these men gave information concerning any church affiliation *end* With the
other Collinses usually if they do have a church affiliation it is Episcopalian *end* The Collins famliy also
built the world’s fastest nicest ocean going ships during the s for which they spared no expense *end* The Collins lost a number of ships to natural sea disasters and after the financial panic of  the
Collins got out of shipping and directed their attention to coal and iron *end* They had a home on

Madison Ave *end* NY *end* One of the Collins who is clearly descended from the old New England family is
the banker Atwood Collins - who graduated from Yale in  *end* One line of Collins that
were descended from the old New England family were the father and son who gave their names to
several locations in Western US *end* Fort Collins CO is named after Cal *end* William Oliver Collins a
descendent of Edward Collins who arrived in Boston from England in  *end* And Casper Wyoming
is named after Col *end* William O *end* Collin’s son Casper Collins *end* Casper Collins died fighting indians and
so this family line died out *end* Col *end* William Oliver Collins family were well-to-do Episcopalians *end* W.O *end* Collins had originally gone to law school then became a Senator and then was made a Colonel by
the Secretary of War at the outbreak of the Civil War *end* Because the U.S *end* troops in the far west were



widely dispersed the rank of Colonel was a very high rank to hold in the western territories during
the Civil War *end* Now this article will list a few Collins who I suspect may have been connected to the

John Anderson Collins-- He was intimately involved with the illuminati plots involving
Unitarians/Rosicrucians/& Masons which created militant abolitionists who intended to wage war

study my chapter on the Unitarian church in Be Wise As Serpents *end* John Anderson Collins was a
socialist forerunner of what is known as communism *end* He attempted several communist social
experiments beginning in the s *end* The importance of how this all connects to the occult and the
Illuminati can be appreciated by reading Fire in The Minds of Men by James Billington *end*
John Churton Collins--In  he wrote a book on Voltaire and in  he wrote yet another book
on Voltaire *end* As a lecturer who travelled to the U.S *end* and Germany the press always gave him great

I could continue giving more names on the suspect list but the reader’s patience has likely been
tested enough *end* Articles like this aren’t as much fun to write when I have to pad out some hard
evidence with clues *end* I included some of the suspects so that the readers can see that people with the
last name of Collins do show up with some frequency when one investigates the occult and power *end* Some readers might feel that any last name could be run through history and some people involved in
the occult found *end* I challenge people to test that *end* I will give them some names and let them search *end* There are some names such as Gould for instance that reoccur way out of proportion in Masonic
literature than the name should randomly occur *end* Russell is another name that reoccurs everywhere
turned in studying the New World Order *end* It became evident that the Russell family was not a
common family but wielded immense power *end* On the opposite side of things some families have
been essentially totally unconnected with the occult in anyway *end*




Prior to the Civil War the American branch of the Collins family split off under the surname of Todd *end* Numerous occult figures including important names in secret Satanism or various Witchcraft groups
have had the last name of Todd *end* Presidents Madison and Lincoln were married to Todds *end* Lincoln’s
wife Mary Todd was into the occult *end* Whether Abraham Lincoln is in heaven or not I do not know
those decisions are God Almighty *end* But from examining the evidence as carefully and honestly as
possible-Abraham Lincoln was a Rosicrucian and in fact he was a member of the Order of the Lily’s
Council of Three along with Paschal Beverly Randolph and General Ethan Allen Hitchcock *end* Properly
speaking those Todds who are descended from the Collins family should have been covered in this
because they are considered by the Illuminati as part of the Collins bboodline *end* The Todd family hasn’t
been covered now but may possibly be written about more fully at a later date *end* In summary the
Collins family is one of the top Illuminati families that has managed to remain low key *end* It is believed
that the Collins family has been kept secret because they wield more power than the Rothschilds
Rockefellers or the Onassises *end* The only way that I came to realize their importance is through a
number of people giving inside information and the only reason that the inside information was
plausible was the great amount of research I had done in this area *end* And yet what has been done is a
drop from what can be accomplished *end* My research shows the family has been connected to witchcraft
since they arrived in New England in the s and may well have practiced it centuries prior to that *end* At least part of the British Collins family are Jewish *end*


REVISITING THE COLLINS FAMILY--ONE OF THE TOP  ILLUMINATI FAMILIES

The Collins family is one of the most powerful families in the world and yet has been able to hide
their power and wealth *end* The Van Duyn family has also hidden themselves very well *end* But the Collins
family is full of tantalizing clues such as one Collins branch that I found in looking at genealogical
family group sheets *end* This was a book that Gerald E *end* Collins’ drew up showing the Collins family and
their relationship to the Bauer family who according to his book changed their name to Bower *end* That
is exactly what the Rothschild relatives named Bauer did *end* The name Collins originated in the British
Isles in Ireland it began as O’Collins and in Scotland as Kollyns *end* Today a prominent figure in
Wicca is the Wiccan reformer Kollyns whose name was originally Collins *end* Two significant Collinses
were Sara Aynn Collins and her older brother *end* Her older brother was a member of the Satanists who
called themselves the Hell Fire Club *end* He belonged to the Boston Hell Fire Club *end* The Hell Fire Club
has been discussed in previous newsletters *end* It has been pointed out in the past articles how BenJamin
Franklin and Thomas Jefferson were members of this purely Satanic group who practiced satanic
sexual occult rituals *end* Sara Aynn Collins bn *end* c *end*  was deeply attracted to the occult *end* Her family
was a generational Witchcraft/Satanic family but many of them wanted to abandon the occult *end* Besides not wanting to leave the old family traditions of witchcraft Sara did not want to marry the
man her father tried to sell her to *end* Neither the arranged marriage nor forsaking witchcraft was for
Sara *end* She went to Scotland to get to the heart of learning the occult and became a leader in the oldest
form of Wicca the Elven Path *end* Other traditional types of Wicca in the U.S *end* come from Ireland
Wales and Greece *end* After the American Revolution she left Scotland skilled in occult power and
came back to the United States where she formed the first Covendom of Wicca *end* She and her brother
were powerful Wiccans and their descendants are the main group of Collinses that practice Wicca
and Satanism *end* A wild woman stabbed Sara Aynn Collins to death in a Boston store *end* What you have
just received is the important link in tracing the Satanic Collins bloodline *end* Sara Aynn Collins and
there were several Sarah Ann Collins in her day-it seems the name appealed to the Collins family is
in turn a descendent of Francis Collins of the  century *end* Francis was the head of the family when it
came over from England *end* The Todd family seems to have Satanic undertones to it even in the days
just after the Revolutionary War *end* For instance John Jacob Astor married Sarah Todd who had a fair
amount of money attached to her *end* The Todd surname is not an extremely common name-until one
begins researching the conspiracy and then it pops up with frequency *end* It is known that during the
time of the Civil War the Collins bloodline went into the surnames of Todd and Putman *end*


It needs to be brought out here that the Putman family also has spelled their name Putnam *end* One
genealogy book which ties the Putman/Putnam family to the Collins family is Putnam Thomas
Russell  *end* Putnam genealogy; recording the descendants of Thomas Putnam *end* The Be Wise As
Serpents book exposed the early Clinton family of DeWitt Clinton as an illuminati family *end* Interestingly there was a Collins boy born in  who was named after that Satanist *end* His name was
DeWitt Clinton Collins - *end* Another interesting tidbit was that the Phelps family of Virginia
is related to the Collins *end* The Phelps family arrivedMass *end* in  and became a prominent family in
the Skull & Bones *end* And don’t forget men like Skull & Bones William Collins Whitney unit *end* into
S&B  of the Collins family *end* Ths member of the Collins lineage had two sons who both became
members of the Illuminati’s Order of the Skull & Bones *end* William Collins Whitney - and
his two sons are the core of the Whitney influence in the Order of the Skull & Bones *end* This Collins
blood of the Whitney’s then went into the Harriman family *end* Anyone who has been reading this
newsletter this year knows how important the Harrimans are *end* Pam Harriman is the person behind Bill
Clinton *end* Further the Collins blood of the Whitney’s went into the Payne family and the Vanderbilts
by intermarriage *end* The Payne family has been a big part of the Rockefellers and Standard Oil *end* It is a
small world at the top *end* William Collins Whitney had a lack luster career as an inspector of schools *end* But then beginning in the s he amassed a fortune from who knows where very quickly *end* William
Collins Whitney was the power behind Pres Cleveland who was his puppet *end* He also directed a group
of powerful important capitalists called the Whitney Group *end* W.C *end* Whitney married Flora Payne *end* Their son Harry Payne Whitney married Gertrude Vanderbilt in  *end* Their son and remember he
still has Collins blood Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney married Marie Norton who later married W *end* Averell Harriman unit *end* into S&B in  the man who helped finance Hitler to power *end* The
Harrimans also helped bring the Bush family from oblivion back in the early s *end* When Prescott
Bush George Bush’s father lost all his money in the  stock market crash the Harrimans again
came to financially helped Prescott Bush back on his feet *end* During the s the W *end* Averell
Harriman Prescott Bush Fritz Thyssen and Friedrich Flick created several entitles to help finance
Hitler and to produce the weapons Hitler would need to fight W.W *end* II. *end* One of these companies was
the German Steel Trust in German called Vereinigte Stahlwerke *end* This company produced % of
Nazi Germany’s explosives .% of Germany’s pig iron .% of Nazi Germany’s galvanized
steel % of Germany’s heavy plate  *end* % of Germany’s wire and many other things essential for
Hitler if it had not been Harriman’ *end* and Bush’s money helping Thyssen who was Hitler’s major
backer Hitler would never had been able to have launched W.W *end* II *end* Thyssen even wrote a book in
the  *end* I paid Hitler now rare telling about how he financed Hitler and the Nazis beginning in
Oct *end*  *end* As I have said numerous times Hitler was of the Rothschild bloodline *end*
An understanding of the top  families opens up a whole new understanding of history *end* In fact the
full extent of the power of the top  families is far greater than what I am able to communicate *end* This
is because of their skill at secrecy *end* Allow me to explain *end* It was no accident that Hitler’s Rothschild
blood was hidden *end* A common practice among the top  families is to have an important child
secretly or quietly without fanfare and adopt the child out to another family *end* The child then takes on
another last name which hides the genealogy in the occult ceremonies the biological parents will
step forward *end* For instance for Mothers of Darkness the biological father must impregnate the young
daughter who is being initiated into the Mothers of Darkness *end* The first baby by the girl must come
from her biological father and must be sacrificed by her to Satan *end* Many of the Illuminati children are
adopted out in fact our President Clinton was *end* To try and trace the genealogy of the Illuminati is
most difficult *end* What I am trying to lead up to saying is that due to a number of reasons-many people
with last names which are different than the top  surnames as well as the several names I’ve given
for the  bloodline I have given are ALSO part of the top  bloodlines *end* Last names are not the
criteria--the magical occult power in their blood is *end* It is more than just having the correct blood--but
the magic power in that blood is critical *end* Once a branch loses its occult power its blood is nothing *end* This is why even though my wife is a descendent from the Holy Blood line the  family her
branch of the family has had nothing to do with the occult for centuries and could never be part of
Illuminati *end* In summary this article has given some critical names in the early genealogy of the
Satanic branch of the Collins family *end* This article has discussed how important events in our world are
being molded by those  families secretly for example the Collins family *end* Finally it was discussed



how the Illuminati have a number of ways that they hide their genealogies and one of these is the
common practice of adopting out a child so that it gets a different last name *end*
Satanist Bonewitz calls the leading Illuminati families "Fam-Trads." He spells out that Fam-Trads
mean the very powerful families that have been the actual ones to pass witchcraft down from one
generation to the next *end* Bonewitz’s article clalms that the only coherent lineage of witchcraft was what
these powerful families have given us *end* They were able to pass down witchcraft uninterrupted because
they were so powerful *end* He writes "There is plenty of evidence of ancient Pagan traditions surviving
under thin Christian veneers in isolated parts of Christendom but there is almost nothing logical to
suggest that the people leading these traditions were in touch with each other..." How did the leading
powerful families continue to practice their witchcraft *end* Bonewitz’s answer is interesting He states



· REVISITING THE COLLINS FAMILY

Isaac Bonewitz who sits on the llluminati’s Grand Druid Council wrote in "Witchcraft" which was a
series of articles in the Green Egg in  some very interesting statements about the top Illuminati
families *end*
Most members of Fam-Trads made efforts to conceal their "superstitlous" beliefs and Pagan magical
systems *end* Instead they became involved in Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism in the  century
Spiritualism and Theosophy in the ; for all these movements were considered more respectable
than witchcraft and still allowed the Fam-Trads to practice occult arts .. *end* So as the years went by
members of the Fam-Trads absorbed more and more from non-pagan magical sources and handed
their new information down to each generation often carelessly letting the descendants think that a
Rosicrucian spell or alchemical meditation was a legitimate part of their Pagan heritage *end* So even
today we have Fam-Trad witches who are far closer to being Theosophists or Spiritualists than to
being Classical or Neoclassical witches *end* Bonewitz Isaac *end* "Witchcraft" The Green Egg June
 Pt *end* III pp *end* - *end*


In  Lord Petre Grand Master in the Masonic Lodges in the British colonies appointed John
Collins to be the Provincial Grand Master of Quebec *end* Co-authored by a board of Masonic editors
History of the Ancient and Honorable Fraternity of Free and Accepted Masons & Concordant Orders *end* Boston & NY The Fraternity Pub *end* Co *end*  p *end*  *end* I mention John Collins as an example of a
powerful  century Freemason who was part of what appears to be the Collins Illuminati family *end* In previous articles we have documented how the early  century Astors and DuPonts were active
Freemasons *end* The history of these top families does agree with Bonewitz that in order to continue to
practice their witchcraft they used the cover of Freemasonry *end* Later in the  century some of the
leading families can be seen to have moved into Spiritualism such as the British royal family and
Mary Baker Eddy of the Baker famliy *end* Interestingly H.P *end* Blavatsky who was involved with spiritism
started the Theosophical Society and also a periodical named Lucifer in  *end* The woman who co-
edited Lucifer with her was the medium now called a channeler Mabel Collins *end* Mabel Collins later
had a disagreement with H.P.B *end* and left *end* Oppenheim Janet *end* The Other World *end* Cambridge Eng *end* Cambridge Univ *end* Press p. *end* And it is possible that a few of the Rockefellers joined Lucis Trust
which is an extension of Theosophy a well as members of the Hall family such as Manly P *end* Hall
whose wife was a Bauer very likely part of the Rothschild bloodline *end* This pattern that Bonewitz has
pointed out to us is worthy of continued investigation it is likely that other leading families have also
followed the pattern he describes *end* The  top Illuminati families are more correctly described as
bloodlines *end* The Collins family had a branch that shot off from it during the early s which was the
Todd family *end* The Todd family branch remained an important part of the Illuminati *end* We will now
discuss this branch in more detail as I said I might in the Feb *end*  ‘ newsletter *end*




the TODD BRANCH of the COLLINS FAMILY



HOT TODDY & HER FATHER JOHN TODD

Thelma Todd was known as Hot Toddy *end* She was an extremely sexy movie actress but she also had
another side to her *end* She was intimately involved with the mob and men like Lucky Luciano *end* Hot
Toddy was intimate with Lucky Luciano who made money from gambling drugs and prostitution *end* In  she was murdered *end* The murderer left her corpse with  in jewelry on it *end* In  the
book Hot Toddy by Andy Edmonds solves the murder which the police did not want to solve and
tried to cover up *end* Thelma was originally from  Andover St Lawrence Mass *end* Her father was John
Shaw Todd and her mother Alice *end* Her father had been a corrupted police lieutenant before going into
politics *end* John’s cronies would come over to their house to the parlor *end* By  John Todd became
"one of the most important men in the East *end* He was appointed Massachusetts director of public health
and welfare a job that gave him carte blanche to write checks and approve construction and medical
contracts offer political positions on high-paying state committees most as repayment for favors
and pass funding along to handpicked organizations and charities *end* Many believed he lined his pockets
on more than one appointment or contract." Edmonds Andy *end* Hot Toddy *end* NY William Morrow &
Co *end* p *end*  *end* In  he became a "political advisor" to legislators *end* In  he used his influence to
get good reviews in newspapers of the film his daughter was in *end* Hot Toddy had a reputation for going
braless for flirting with men etc *end* She as a teenager had a secret desire to be a madam at a brothel *end* p *end* She was sponsored by the Elks Lodge in a beauty contest in  and was selected Miss
Massachusetts *end* Hollywood even in the early s was full of murders the weirdest sexual habits
imaginable and most of the actors were drug addicts cocaine heroin and booze *end* That was years
before these habits hit the mainstream of American life *end* Many actors were homosexual *end* Many if not
most the lists I have seen would indicate most actors were Jewish *end* Charles Luciano was nicknamed
Charile Lucifer "the devil." He was the most feared and hated of the underworld bosses *end* Luciano
liked Toddy both because he was attracted to her and she had a restaurant he wanted to use for one of
his bases of operations on the third floor for gambling *end* Luciano was one of the three major
distributors for the Bronfman’s narcotics *end* The Bronfmans are outwardly Jewish and covertly
satanists *end* Remember they were mentioned in the previous Collins article being friends of actor Joan
Collins *end* Rothstein and Meyer Lansky were the other two Bronfman distributors *end* Dope *end* Inc *end* p *end*
Luciano supplied Hot Toddy with her drugs *end* At the time of her murder her movie boss had planned
to raise her salary to  a week *end* Luciano worked for the U.S *end* government during W.W *end* II and in
 was deported to Sicily *end* During W.W.II Luciano work for US *end* Intelligence--SOE and OSS *end* Where else in this newsletter have I mentioned the corruption in the Intelligence Agencies *end* After
being "deported" to Sicily Luciano continued to work for US *end* Intelligence and Permindex Dope *end* Inc *end* p *end* -which is the elite’s assassination bureau which later moved the center of its headquarters
to Paradise Island in the Grand Bahamas *end* Dope *end* Inc *end* p *end* It seems to me that Luciano had
connections to Onassis *end* I noticed that there was a man named Collins who was involved with the
Illuminati’s movements to take over the Australian economy *end* He was an executive of H.W *end* Smith
one of those companies that interlock with the CIA mob and Illuminati *end* As you may realize I offer
these types of clues because I can’t presume on the future and hope that others will asist in putting
together the pieces of how widespread the satanic Collins family is *end*


JOHNNY TODD

Johnny Todd is reported to have converted to Christ on Labor Day  according to one person I
talked to *end* It seemed like the talk I heard Johnny Todd give indicated  as his coversion date *end* He
was of the Collins family Todds and at some point after coming to Christ told people he had been a
member of the Grand Druid Council of the Illuminati *end* Before proceeding to tell about his life lets
interrupt to discuss about whether Johnny Todd is for real or not *end* Johnny Todd has been discredited
as a fraud within much of the Christian community *end* If I had heard all the negative things said about



Johnny Todd first I might not be writing anything about him because some of the people against him
don’t have anything good to say *end* However I heard tapes of Johnny Todd speak before I heard the
negative things about him *end* What has taken me years to understand he went item by item and
discussed *end* I have tried to understand what Johnny Todd did to get discredited and the central issue
seems that a tape he made after he was converted had his voice saying a satanic ritual *end* I must warn the
readers that I haven’t gotten to the bottom of who Johnny Todd is but I was able to ascertain several
things *end*
·Even the people who feel Johnny Todd was a fraud admit he had to have been in Satanism-they
simply claim he wasn’t as high as he thought *end*
·Every negative thing that has been said toward Johnny Todd that has any substance that I have been
able to hear can be explained away very easily if a person understand MPD *end* If Johnny Todd was who
he claimed he was then it is an absolute given that he had MPD because that is part of the "training"
part of the preparation neccessary to become part of the Illuminati hierarchy *end* In other words the
negative things which appear to be insurmountable obstacles to his credibility may actually if people
knew what being involved with the Illuminati is like be items showing his authenticity *end* Further it
appears that after his conversion to Christ he received so much lack of understanding and persecution
from Christians that he back slide for a period of time but was brought back to Christ by the repeated
message "Jesus loves you." The clincher was listening to the man *end* After having done years of
research and hearing someone tell me much of what I learned the slow and hard way was very
exciting *end* The man speaks like someone who knows Satanism and the Satanic hierarchy and knows it
first hand *end* I have listened to many Christians speak on Satanism and on a scale of  to  most of
them are about step  Todd in my opinion from the talks I have heard rates around an  *end* If he is
such a fraud why is what he is saying such superior information than all the other people *end* People
claim he simply borrowed from other people but that doesn’t hold water *end* I know of no one else who
has openly talked about the Collins family *end* I could be wrong--he may not be legitimate--but I feel so
strongly from what I have experienced that I honestly believe that the man is just what he says he is *end* And in that case he is one of the highest Satanic hierarchy people to defect to Christianity who have
been willing to talk *end* Johnny Todd is not talking now-the establishment got him put into prison in
South Carolina *end*
· EX-ILLUMINATUS EXPLAINS HOW THE ILLUMINATI FRAMED HIM AND PUT HIM
IN PRISON *end*
This article is comes from a tape which was made by someone who is part of the Collins Bloodline
one of the top  Illuminati bloodlines *end* i transcribed this tape onto paper because I feel it deals with
an important person and some important issues *end* Christians need to realize that what happened to this
man who left and tried to expose the illuminati is what is in store for many other Christians that is
prison *end* The Be Wise As Serpents book had an entire chapter on the Concentration camps that are
already built for Christians *end* There are friends of mine who feel very convinced this ex-illuminatus is
the real thing and that he was really part of the Illuminati *end* Then there are some who feed he is not
for real *end* There has been an intense program of discrediting this man which was orchestrated by the
illuminati and their plants within the Christian people *end* I have listened to both sides of the issue and
then listened to the man himself and I am convinced he is for real *end* I believe he was really part of the
illuminati *end* That was this author’s conclusion although I’m not so firm that I wouldn’t bend if new
evidence confirmed differently *end* I have listened to hours of accusations that were leveled against this
ex-Illuminatus even before he was framed and most if not all amount to nothing *end* When I have asked
people what their objections were to this man they have said they are convinced he is was a Satanist
but that they doubt his illuminati credentials *end* But the man is part of one of the most powerful
bloodlines in the worid the Collins family *end* Whether he got high in Illuminati can be debated but if he
were in Satanism which many acknowledge he would have--almost certainly-- been taken into an
Illuminati coven *end*




MESSAGE FROM A HIERARCHY SURVIVOR

Feb *end*

I am John Todd and this tape is being made in a prison cell in South Carolina it is very late at night *end* All the inmates are locked down in their cells but you will still hear noise off and on *end* And if the
guard comes by I have to stop and be very quiet *end* The reason for this tape is that I have been framed
and put in prison by orders of U.S *end* Senator from South Carolina Strom Thurmond *end* I’ll go into all the
reasons for that and what happened to me *end* And only recently in fact just about a week and a half ago
did I find out how it was really accomplished *end* As I started to say the reason for this tape is to get the
word out about where I’m at *end* I’ve been in custody almost four years now *end* I’ve been in a prison cell
for three years and that time is a very closely guarded secret by the government by the Illuminati and
definitely by the conspirators *end* The word of what has happened to me has not gotten out of the state of
South Carolina *end* Here you have religious magazines that are run by the Illuminati speakers who are
members within their organization or collaborators who have been bought by them over the years *end* Many of them who would consider themselves to be personal enemies of mine because of exposes
which came out about them by me in the ‘s- early ‘s *end* Yet not one of them has said a word
although they al know about it for fear that the true believers that are out there will find out what has
happened to me *end* When I was arrested one of the few things that was taken from my apartment was
my files containing my mailing list *end* These were taken by the police although they had nothing to do
with the case I was supposedly being charged with *end* And two years later when we went through a law
suit to get everything back this was one of the few items that did not come back *end* They Just vanished
just disappeared *end* The reason for it a was the reason for taking the two personal address books that I
had *end* One I carried in my billfold for such an emergency and one was in my Ubrary shelf were taken
by SLED also *end* This was hopefully to keep me from contact with anybody who could help me obtain
legal services or whatever *end* I want to go into the case very carefully very diligently *end* One of the things
that seems to be very frightening to Christians is that such a thing could actually take place *end* Many
who knew I was innocent could not believe that I had been found guilty *end* Not so much that -because-
it just wasn’t there it didn’t take place so therefore even the manufactured evidence wasn’t even
there *end* They just couldn’t believe that a child of God in this country could go to prison *end* I had stopped
and came to the door *end* I can’t let this tape be known that it is being made or it would never get out of
here *end* I want to say this now before I go on whoever receives a copy of this tape I’m asking you to
make a copy or copies and get the word out *end* Make phone calls *end* Let people know what has happened
to me *end* Let them know that they can be of service to get me out of here *end* This is what is most feared
about putting me in here that the word will get out *end* Let me tell you what all has happened here *end* We
need to go back to  in Columbia South Carolina where I was living *end* I had been hurt *end* I had been
doing labor construction work carpenter work for several years *end* I had stopped speaking publicly
after my divorce to the woman who had stood beside me for years and years and years headquarters *end* Give me a polygraph." Immediately in the form of a scream I can assure you not a statement the
SLED agent a Lt *end* Carleton Meddle who is now a captain who was made captain three days after I
was convicted overpromoted- promoted over peoplefront of him screamed out loud "No we’re
not going to give you a polygraph.’ That was their stance ali the way through *end*
I took a polygraph after my conviction *end* I paid for the polygraph *end* I - the polygraph *end* But it’s not
admissible in court *end* Now they took me-- Pm going to go through this all so you can see *end* Immediately
I knew this whole thing was a frame *end* I wasn’t sure what they were up to but let it go *end* The solicitor
sald he wanted to have my apartment searched for evidence of the rape And that he could get a
search warrant but they would prefer that I allow them to search *end* Well" I said I have an attorney
who is representing me in the lawsuit *end* He is also a criminal attorney if you allow me to call him you
allow me to ask his advice and he says "yes" I will allow you to do it." They really didn’t have a
choice in this matter *end* I was asking for my attorney and they were supposed to *end* They took me in the
hospital downstairs to the security room *end* I didn’t know this at the time but out of the  arresting
officers that were SLED there five were lieutenants in the room with me out of the  Lieutenants la
the state *end* That’s unheard of *end* Plus the head solicitor *end* It gets better *end* They take me into a room *end* The
solicitor calls my attorney *end* I still didn’t realize who he was or anything *end* He called my attorney *end* I



spoke with my attorney *end* He told my attorney that if he allowed me to sign this thing *end* and then again
he told that they didn’t have a search warrant which was a lie *end* The search warrant was limited as to
what they could have took trom my apartment *end* They weren’t interested in anything in the rape as you
will find out *end* They were interested in other materials which they could not have took under the
search warrant *end* So they told him they will take me straight to Jal they will go to my apartment and
search it *end* I signed it *end* They took me to my apartment *end* They had lied to my attorney *end*
They proceeded to box up three  gallon plastic trash bags and four boxes with material *end* Nothing
except  knifes- that they claimed they were trying to find the knife which was used in the rape *end* I
showed them where all my knifes were and some business stationary with the publishing company *end* Other than that knife nothing that went out of there was used during the trial *end* Nothing was used
except what I just said *end* Everything else was business material printing concerning my past ministry
or the ministry I was involved I which was the newsletter *end* The whole time I was there I was not
questioned about sexual assault as they put it I was only asked questions about the Christian
underground *end* I want to stop and explain that *end* There is though some of you might find it shocking
there is an undergroundthe United States a Christian underground *end* It was formed over the trials in
Nebraska where Christians pastors ministers of the church were sent to prison *end* Where we started
seeing non-passed laws about child abuse being put into effect by the federal and state governments
without ever being passed as law *end* Children were being taken from their parents without a chance for
the parent to he allowed to speak in the trial *end* All it took was some child psychologist "I suspect child
abuse blah blah blah." We started seeing how % of the people being tried were fundamentalist
Christians so an underground was formed *end* It contained Christian survivalists but it contained
everyday people also *end* And all they wanted was where these safe houses were where these places of
refuge were what the underground conductors who they were *end* That"s all they were asking me *end* And
yet nothing wasSouth Carolina So it was out of their jurisdiction *end* So I knew they were asking for
the federal government *end* I was taken from there to SLED and for the first time I was questioned
concerning the so-called rape *end* I realized you would have to be arrested to understand the shock you
go through I was just numb *end* But as my head started clearing and I realized that they heldtheir
hands evidence that they had took from the apartment which would clear me I told them *end* I also told
them about my whereabouts that night *end* I told them people they could go question *end* And here’s their
statement "it is not our job to go question witnesses that will prove your innocence." While I was at
SLED headquarters the solicitor who had lef’t us after we had left the apartment went and held a
press conference *end* This was his story I was arrested for one rape I was suspected in three maybe as
many as eighty *end* That’s right *end* Family members on their way home from work at five thirty in the
evening were hearing this on the radio *end* Never before was anybody that wasn’t a murderer ever given
this much publicity and never before in the history of SLED had a person who was charged only with
criminal sexual assault ever been investigated or charged by SLED *end* Before I was even booked in the
jail I realized that these folks did not believe I was guilty *end* They were only interested in something
else *end* I wasn’t sure quite yet what *end* The next morning I was brought before a state magistrate for a ball
hearing and to be arraigned *end* I was denied bail on the following *end* Now listen to this *end* The solicitor tells
the magistrate the following I’m not a resident of South Carolina *end* Bat he had just searched my
apartment *end* I had several businesses in South Carolina and had lived here for years *end* Further they said I
had no recidence in South Carolina *end* And yet they had just searched it *end* Three they said I had a
passport and they were worried I’d flee the country *end* The passport had been taken from my apartment
and had expired on that very day on my birthday of  and they knew it *end* The next statement was
that I had no visible means of support *end* And yet they knew that I did *end* And the last one was that I had
no family members in South Carolina and yet I had children right here *end* As I tried to tell the
magistrate this was all incorrect he wouldn’t hear it *end* I had not yet realized that I was on the front
cover of the state newspaper *end* Now the state newspaper is the newspaper in Columbia *end* It had a co-
owned newspaper called The Record which does not exist now *end* They have combined them *end* The
newspapers print whatever the authorities want them to print in this state *end* The interesting thing in this
was that it started to go into my military record *end* Now the Illuminati and collaborators in the Christian
church have bled to discredit me for years *end* Mainly they have said that I have lied about my
participation in the military what I was involved in that I was in Vietnam or any of this *end* During the
next several days the state became very upset at the U *end* S *end* military because the US *end* military sald I was



involved in a military group in Vietnam called Phoenix and that all members who were in Phoenix
their military records were sealed and in Langley VA *end* with the CIA *end* That is what I have said for
years and years and years *end* And after all this thousands and thousands of dollars paid to the
collaborators within the Christian Church to Illuminati collaborators and plants have put out about
me *end* This newspaper which was trying to harm me destroyed it in a matter of days *end* I became known
as the survivalist raplst or the green beret rapist and it all came out about me being ex-special forces
green beret *end* All this stuff denied by Christianity Today and Logos and all these others for over a year
was Just blown away in a matter of moments *end* Over the next two weeks it went from I was suspected
of  rapes to  rapes *end* Everyday the solicitor was holding a news conference *end* Everyday I was
smeared in the news *end* In fact when they realized that either what they could frame me of was falling
apart on them they proceeded to take my picture and put it on the television *end* "We know he has done
all this would anybody who has been followed by this man please come forward." They broadcast my
picture all over the state *end* And I imagine-I was told- hundreds of crank calls but nothing ever came out
because nothing had ever happened *end* Aud the problem was and we’re only guessing here is the
solicitor had been tricked by SLED *end* The solicitor really believed this *end* And he thought it was a high
publicity case and it blew up on him and he was embarrassed *end* But he was being asked we uncovered
this *end* This is how it went before my arrest *end* And I think you will be surprised by the lies ?or irony *end* in
all this *end* SLED took statements from Meryl Blackburn  a.m *end* Sunday morning  -I’m sorry -
May  Monday morning--l’m sorry *end* It was actually Monday morning May  at  in the
morning *end* They arrested me at  in the afternoon *end* After taking statements a close friend of Strom
Thurmond who was sexually involved with the woman who was all these women’s bosses came
down to SLED headquarters went with them to solicitor James Anders office and told Anders he
wanted me sent to prison; he didn’t care how *end* He then went to the state magistrate and got a warrant
signed *end* This politician who lived hundreds of miles away came down here for that precise purpose
and was involved *end* His name was Larry Martin *end* Now the reason that Strom Thurmond hated me in
case you’re familiar or not familiar with this is that when I was living in California working with
Chick publications and preaching very heavily in ‘ and doing mostly exposes on everybody it had
come out about Strom Thurmond being the highest ranking Mason in the world and that he was also
a member of the voting Board of Regents for the Bob Jones University *end* Now the first thing that Bob
Jones University did was to deny that Thurmond was a Mason *end* But Thurmond wouldn’t go along
with it *end* He knew he was too well known as being a Mason *end* So he came out and tried to defend
Masonic beliefs that Christians can be that *end* It blew up on him *end* And he became so outraged that even
though Bob Jones University was always calling me a liar constantly calling me a liar constantly
trying to hurt me; they had to ask him to step down *end* lie was not removed *end* He was only placed to the
non-voting board of regents and *end* believe me he still had all of his power *end* At that Lime I was told he
Thurmond is going to get you for this *end* I made a major mistake *end* I didn’t pray about this *end* I met and I
let people supposedly Christian people talk me into moving to South Carolina *end* These were the first
people to desert me when all this happened *end*
Now the interesting thing about this was all through this the only thing they had was this woman’s
statement *end* And it came out that woman had first went to the sheriff’s department and the sheriff
would not believe her because it had been-- she was talking about so far back that she admitted on the
stand that she never had told anybody that she had never sought medical help *end* There were some
things that I don’t want to testify- I don’t want to say on this tape because it might offend people but
things she described that night would have required her to receive emergency treatment in order to
stay alive if it had really taken place and yet she said she was not hurt not damaged was not bruised *end* She was not cut *end* She was not harmed in any way *end*
The situation was this I was held for nine months in custody walting trial *end* The speedy trial law here
was totaily disregarded by the judge *end* The reason I was held so long is this woman moved out of state
didn’t want to come back to the state *end* It was not- I believe this- it was not really a conspiracy in the
beginning *end* This was a woman who wanted revenge for being fired *end* When it got out of hand she didn’t
know who she was dealing with *end* When it had gotten out of hand and become so publicized and she
saw all these people running around trying desperately to do me in she ran away *end* See what happened
was that when she went to SLED they typed my name into the computer that they have there *end* They



have what they call a black list a hit list that the politicians in South Carolina put people on *end* When
my name popped up it became a field day and it just became too much for her and she left and they
had to force her to come back *end* Now whether she was honest with them or whether they really knew
what had happened or what I do know *end* But they completely changed her appearance for the trial *end* They dyed her hair they put her in different clothes they restyled and cut her hair so that this was
how much she changed *end* I had only seen her a couple times but when she came into the trial I kept
asking my attorney when Meryl Blackburn was going to he there *end* I did not recognize her *end* That’s how
much she had changed *end* And so people who would have seen her that night which were alibi witnesses
of mine would not have been able to perfectly identify her was the plan *end* And the reason for this is that
there were witnesses who could have destroyed her testimony *end* But most important is lab tests that I
happen to know the Lord was behind *end* I checked into the hospital within six or seven hours from when
she claims this had taken place *end* It was supposed to have taken place Mother’s Day weekend of '
and like in the wee hours of Saturday morning *end* And Saturday afternoon around lunchtime I was
checking in to the hospital *end* The test on admittance was this test for alcohol and drugs *end* Now this
woman didn’t know that *end* SLED and the prosecution didn’t know that *end* And this woman claimed in her
affidavit that I had forced her to drink and to take drugs and that I was drinking and taking drugs
along with her *end* The urineanalysis totally proved her to be lying; there were no drags or alcohol in my
system *end* And yet and let me say that O.K *end* finally it was brought to trial Jan *end*  which was a
Thursday of  *end* The jury was selected *end* A week before I was to go to trial I had all the funds that I
had left I settled my law suit out of court which was to he  *end* I settled it out for  and
gave it to my attorney who was supposed to spend it all on a private investigator *end* This private
investigator was an ex-SLED agent *end* Supposediy he tracked down all the witnesses I had told him
There was enough evidence for all this time I sat there and I knew I was going to be found innocent *end* I
knew I was innocent *end* I knew the evidence was there to prove it *end* And the lawyer came and told me
they had the lab tests *end* That they went before the judge and argued against the solicitor and got lab
tests admitted into evidence and it was going to he there *end* He had drawn as he put it  witness’s
subpoenas and had served most of them and was going to have the witnesses there and it was going
to be an open show *end* And so all day of the st I watched the trial not worried and yet not
understanding what my attorney was doing *end* My attorney was making me out to he the bad-you see
my attorney wanted me to take the stand and say I had affair with this woman and she was just upset *end* And I wouldn’t do it *end* I didn’t know at the time that he was in on it *end* And if they lost they really
weren’t going to lose this case *end* If they lost they wanted at least to destroy my reputation *end* And I
couldn’t understand where the witnesses were *end* And I didn’t know until this month that they were
there they were just segregated outside of the courtroom *end* And so all day of the st I listened to the
testimony *end* It was so ridiculous the jurors were laughing at the testimony that’s how ridiculous *end* I
insisted when some nurses were up for jury duty I had insisted they get on the stand because they
would have been able to believe the medical evidence *end* I mean the medical evidence which cleared
me we won right then and there *end*
I couldn’t understand my lawyer put a woman on the jury who admitted it’s in the transcript that her
and her husband had seen the stories and read the stories and had already formed a conclusion *end* Obviously if you had read the stories the conclusion would have been that I was guilty *end* Right *end* And
as far as the public knew I was still being suspected of all these you know hundred something rapes
and nobody knew these didn’t exist and nobody knew they didn’t go anywhere *end* So as this jury took I
couldn’t understand it *end* He said "Oh don’t worry it will be alright I know what I am doing." The
next day we come back I still expecting to present a case the nd of January  still expecting to
present a case *end* They called up a few minor witnesses *end* The only new witness they put on the case they
were trying to prove that the publishing company didn’t exist that it was phony that it was a scam to
draw women into it that I could rape and all this type of stuff *end* This is what the prosecution was trying
to prove *end* There was just too much thousands of dollars yeah blah blah I’ll come and testify and blah
blah." Then he turns around and tells my court appointed attorney for the Post-conviction that he
thinks James Corry that’s the attorney’s name did marvelous work for me sad did the best be could
under the circumstances *end* Yes I’m innocent but no attorney could have done better for me *end* Making
himself a witness who wasn’t usable but he didn’t show up for the trial though he promised *end* This
pastor had files files?-word unclear in his hand to set me free and refused to use it *end* I’ll let you draw



your own conclusions as to why *end* I did not know the full extent of what my attorney had done to me *end* I
was sent to prison *end* Until Feb *end*  a week or so ago ? *end* At the post-conviction in Columbia South
Carolina the only two witnesses present were myself sad the attorney for the state *end* My attorney was
testifying for the state *end* He got on the stand sad lied about several things that meeded to be true that I
need personally knew to be true *end* Now he had told me up until then that the reason be didn’t use the
lab was that it didn’t show a screen for alcohol and for all these years I had believed him *end* On the
stand however knowing that it might come oat he revealed that it did show a screen for alcohol *end* And
be couldn’t give a good reason why he didn’t use it *end* That in also the time I found out that all the
witnesses subpoenaed were sitting outside the courtroom the whole time for two days sad he never
called them *end* Then the court-appointed attorney asked him "Would this witness had contradicted
Meryl Blackburn  *end* "would this one?" "Yes." "Would this one?" "Yes." On and on for the whole time
for two days and be never ? *end* And the court appointed attorney kept asking him "Would this have
contradicted Meryl Blackburn *end* With this one?" "yes" and with this one *end* "Yes." and on and on *end* And
yet be kept saying it wasn’t important to present that *end* It wasn’t important that there wasn’t any
witnesses *end* According to law the lawyer can refuse to call witnesses *end*
However the Constitution says I have a right to have witnesses there *end* Under South Carolina law an
attorney can override the defendent and not call the witnesses *end* And that’s what they did to me *end* So in
essence my Constitutional Rights were blank pause so I was sent to prison without being able to
produce any witnesses *end*
Now we left the Post-conviction hearing on Feb  knowing that it was lost knowing that it was
rigged from the very beginning *end* About the most maJor point why my attorney threw the case *end* The
Judge cut me off *end* We could have documented it and proved it *end* Testify *end* In essence he took our
defense away by not permitting me to testify at all about it *end* Again no fair trial *end* He said I will let you
know in o days" *end* But we knew we knew at the time it was pretty much open and shut *end* But then I
pretty much *end* knew that in no state court would any court appointed attorney was I ever ever going to
get anywhere *end* This attorney should have subpoenaed Rev *end* Randle sad put him on the stand sad be
refused to do so *end* Again not calling witnesses *end* There was another brother named Joe in Charlotte who
was a major witness in the case *end* He would alone got me a new trial but stating that I had called him
from the jail after the first day of the trial and told him I needed him to be a witness at the next day
for him to take off work to corn on down to Columbia and testify *end* He then called my attorney and my
attorney told him not to come *end* This man now won’t even talk to Christians about it *end* When they talk to
him on the phone he’s just terrified he’s scared to death *end* under no circumstances will be come to
Columbia South Carolina *end* There is a conspiracy going on here *end* That could be overruled by an
attorney *end* There are a couple of attorneys in this state who are known that they can’t be gotten to *end* And
they have all told me that my case is open and shut *end* I should never have went to prison *end* I could have
been set free by a couple court orders *end* But I have never been able to get these attorneys *end* And the
reason for me not being able to write anybody or have contact with anybody.. *end* to be continued...in

CONTINUATION

was so that funds could never be reached could never be raised so that I could hire an attorney that
could set me free *end* In May I’ll have been in custody for  years *end* In January this year I was already in
prison for  years for something that I didn’t do and for something that could have proved I was
innocent if I’d just been allowed to produce witnesses *end* In essence I have to hire an attorney who will
subpoena the witnesses who will make no deal to sell me out and will let me have a fair trial *end* There is
something else that you need to know *end* Three days after I was placed in jail without bail my attorney
came to me *end* He said the Federal prosecutor the assistant attorney general whatever you want to call
him the attorney solicitor wanted to make a deal *end* Now remember I was facing a state charge not a
federal charge *end* But this was the Feds *end* Now all I had to do was tell him where all the Christians were
hiding identify all these people in the underground and I could go free *end* And I said no *end* It’s a matter of
record that a federal proffer this is an immunity grant for testimony was offered me--it’s on record--
and it was turned down *end* After I was convicted in ‘ I was sent to prison in Columbia--there are
several *end* Kirkland was the name of mine *end* I was called up front and I was told to sit down and wait that
the secret service was coming to talk to me *end* The woman supervising omcer who was on duty found it
strange that this secret service agent who was supposed to be locally from Columbia did not know
where the prison was *end* And she just said "Boy they are hiring dumb people today we had to give him
instruction how to get here." When he arrived he let it slip out that he was actually a member of
President Reagan’s body guard staff from Wash *end* D.C *end* He said that he had to leave in a couple of days
to Moscow *end* This was right before the Reagan-Moscow trip *end* And that he had to get ready to set up for
the President *end* What was he doing here *end* And all he wanted was the same information *end* Of course it
was the information *end* Why was the secret service involved *end* He was a member of Reagan’s staff *end* Now
after that I was left alone everything was left alone for a long time *end* And then in ' in the winter of
‘ the FBI came *end* I had been moved to a ah- I had been in three prisons *end* They keep moving me
around and they are fixing to move me again is what they tell me *end* The FBI came this was late at night
I was brought from my cell after everyone else was locked down and I was taken up front *end* There
were two agents of the FBI *end* They said they were there to question me again was I willing to talk *end* was I willing to make a deal *end* I said "no." They said all this could be behind me I said "no" *end* They
left *end* They’ve came back three other times *end* Finally they quit coming *end* I guess they are getting the
message *end* But I kindof expect them to show up now that I’ve lost the post-conviction *end* As soon as I get
notified in writing that I’ve lost this post-conviction I expect for them to show up again trying to
know if I wili make a deal; the answer is ‘no." Isn’t it amazing that I’m supposed to be this terrible
rapist on a state charge that the Feds somehow have authority over this state charge and they are
willing to let me just go wipe it off the books for turning Christians who are wanted for nothig a lot
of times nothing but misdemeanor warrants or child custody warrants where the state wants to take
the kids or for violations of court orders *end* A lot of these people are on the run from Christian schools
where the state has sworn out warrants for these Christians because they were teaching the children
and the state decided that this was not right and so on *end* Little stuff and yet they are willing to let me
go for all these people plus the Christians who are hiding them out *end* I think you’d better wake up
brothers and sisters because I was sent to prison without the right to a fair trial and I want tell you
what *end* It could be done real easy *end* It could be done real easy *end* They control the media *end* They could say
anything about you they want to say *end* They control the governments *end* They control the police forces *end* Wake up *end*
I want to go into something else that is going on right now in the news *end* For over twelve years I have
said that the goal of the United States government was to activate what is called Operation Garden
Plot and its sub-plot Operation Cablesplice *end* Which was martial law total military control over all
police forces governments and so on *end* I’ve said that in order to do that they wanted the populace out
there to scream at the president that he wasn’t doing his job of protecting them from acts of terrorism *end* And that they were willing to give up their constitutional rights *end* Now we have seen time and time



again in order to stop the drug wars to stop the drug dealers and all the bloodshed that they are
willing to give up Constitutional rights *end* People are willing to do it *end* People when terrorism strikes are
willing to do it *end* Now for years the Illuminati have tried to have the Arab countries be so outraged that
they would start terrorism in the United States on a great massive rate *end* And our country is more
susceptible than any other country for the simple reason that we are not prepared for it *end* We don’t
believe it could happen to us *end* And they thought they were going to be able to do it in Lebanon *end* They
didn’t pull it off *end* They thought by hitting Gaddafi he would act he wasn’t able to strike back *end* He was
unable to do it *end* And now we are involved in a war whose sole purpose is to have those acts of
terrorism launched upon us in this country *end* The media has hyped every act of terrorism they could
dredge up in recent years.-F *end* And I will leave you with that *end* Now people soon you will all be in the
same danger I’m in *end* I’m asking for your help *end* I assure you in the name of our lord Jesus Christ I am
innocent of this charge *end* I state so before the Lord and you in his name *end* I’m innocent of this *end* Is it any
surprise that John Todd who did them so much damage will be framed and sent to prison *end* Remember
that I warned everybody about it that it would happen  years before it happened *end* I was warned *end* What
is so agitating in this is that Christians who should have stood by me who knew I was innocent

was so clear *end* I am asking for your help *end* I’m sending this tape to a couple of ministers who after all

copies of this tape and to make it available *end* People I don’t have much time left in here *end* Right now

Bloodlines of Illuminati

By

Fritz Springmeier

THE DuPONTS

There has been no consistency among the Du Pont family members in the spelling they have
employed to write their name *end* The correct variations in spelling the Du Pont name are as follows
Dupont DuPont du Pont duPont Du Pont and du Pont de Nemours *end* In English the second syllable
is accented *end* In French neither syllable is accented *end* The name has tended to be spelled du Pont for the
family and Du Pont for business *end* I decided for this article to standardize the spelling in line with this
tendency *end*
A DYNASTY OF SATANIC ROYALTY

Sitting down to write about the du Pont.s reminded me of two other families *end* Recently John
Coleman a researcher on the elite commented to me that when he had researched the Queen of
Denmark he had discovered that the royal danish family was slipping away secretly from everyone
and they were going to Satanic rituals *end* It is also noteworthy that  modern kings of Denmark have
been the leaders of Freemasonry in Denmark and the Danish royal family princes etc *end* have been
active Masons *end* John Dale wrote a book The Prince and The Paranormal which goes into the secret
occult activities of the British royal family especially Prince Charles but also many other royal
family members too *end* Besides the secret occult activities of the British Monarch they have been
openly leaders of Freemasonry  see the Appendix of Be Wise As Serpents for a detailed chart on
this *end* The du Ponts are similar to these families in that they too are a dynasty they too have a very
public image and they too have a totally hidden life *end* In fact the du Ponts have better control over the
press’s coverage of them than the British Royal Family *end*
One of the clues that the family is a top Satanic family are the frequency of marriages between
relatives of the du Pont descendants *end* Few people are aware of the immense importance bloodlines
play in the upper levels of Satanism *end* Blood is believed to carry the occult power *end* Unless a person has
the correct blood he or she will not rise to the highest levels of Satanism *end* The du Ponts have
intermarried with the Balls and the Gardners *end* These other familIes are known to be involved with the
Illuminati and Satanism *end* For instance George W *end* Ball is on the important permanent steering
committee of the Bilderbergers and has attended the Bilderberger meetings that I know of starting
with the original first meeting in  plus in
 *end* George W *end* Ball is also a member of CFR and the Trilateral Commission *end* Eliza Cazenove
Gardner was a sister to a du Pont *end* Iorsey Cazenove Gardner was a distant cousin *end* Will Gardner and
Bessie Gardner duPont were cousins of the duPonts *end* John W *end* Gardner is a  Illuminatus and in
charge of the Rockefeller Bros *end* Fund *end* I have found the Gardners in the thick of Satanism and
witchcraft *end*
THE COMPLETE FACTS ARE DIFFICULT TO DISCOVER

At the library I checked out a book Du Pont by William Dutton *end* The book had been a gift to the
library from the fu Pont Company *end* I also checked out a book Alfred I *end* Du Pont by Joseph Frazier

Wall *end* That book’s author J *end* Wall was flnanced to write the book by the trustees of the Jessie Ball du
Pont Fund *end* Although scholarly in appearance it is what they don’t say that can be so crucial to really
understand the history of the du Pont family *end* When a family is worth billions they can afford to tidy
up their family histories and keep people from spilling the beans about secrets *end* On May   the
press reported the death of Alfred Victor du Pont with great laudatory comments *end* Alfred known as
Fred had been in business in Louisville KT and was widely known in the area as a philanthropist *end* Louisville’s main paper the Louisville Commercial gave the public a totally fictitious story about how
Alfred Victor du Pont died along with many pages of the highest praise *end*
If it hadn’t been for the honesty of the Enquirer a Cincinnati paper--not to be confused with today’s
national tabloid by the same name Enquirer the public would not have learned what really had
happened *end* The false story’ said that Fred died of apoplexy while visiting his brother Bidermann *end* The
duPont family still maintains this fiction is true although all the facts of the case are blatantly known
and were public knowledge to quite a number of people whose lives were involved with what actually
happened *end* Both Fred du Pont and his nephew Coleman du Pont were regular customers at the most
expensive house of prostitution in the area Maggie Payne’s bordello *end* Although rich Fred was not
willing to help support a distraught prostitute raise the child she was sure he had sired *end* So she shot
Fred in the heart *end* Coleman du Pont who was familiar with Maggie’s soon went down to Maggie’s
retrieved the body with a hearse and took the body to Biderman’s house *end* There the coroner was
willing to lie on the death certificate that the death was caused by effusive apoplexy.’ It is most
likely Coleman made that lie worth his effort *end* Henry Watterson editor of the Courier-Journal
although he later admitted he knew the real story of the murder went ahead and printed the false story
on behalf of the du Ponts *end*
This article starts out with this anecdote to make a point--the  top families do control the press--and
are very sensitive to any negative publicity of any kind *end* Not only are their Satanic activities deeply
hidden but even just the normal everyday sinfulness or human soap box drama of their lives is deeply
hidden *end* By the way Coleman duPont an extremely hedonistic man is one of the duPonts I strongly
suspect was into Satanism *end* Further secrecy has been obtained by working through trusted proxies *end* Today a key proxy is the jew Irving Saul Shapiro *end* The du Pont family is represented in a number of
groups by Irving Saul Shapiro who is on the Council of Foreign Relations *end* Irving S *end* Shapiro is a key
person who has been the go-between to coordinate the activities of the Rockefellers the du Ponts and
the Watson families Watson family members who are ° Illuminati are mentioned in the //
newsletter *end* Shapiro was a member of Carter’s Advisory Council on Japan-US *end* Economic Relations is
a trustee of the University of Delaware director of the Jewish Federation of Delaware director of
IBM which is a Watson-Rockefeller business director of Citicorp Rothschilds and Rockefellers--
headed in the past by ° Illuminatus CFR member Bilderberger Walter Wristen and the
U.S./U.S.S.R *end* Trade and Economic Council which Rockefeller plays a big part of *end* Shapiro is or was
director of Continental American Insurance Co *end* International Business Machines under IBM *end* Irving Saul Shapiro was chairman of the du Pont company *end*
BEGINNING AT THE BEGINNING

The biographies of the du Pont family usually begin with the marriage of Samuel du Pont to Anne
Alexandrine Montechanin in  in Paris France *end* Although Anne was a Huguenot she was a
medium with the spirit world *end* Anne came from an ancient noble family that lived in Burgandy
France *end* It is quite possible that it was Anne’s bloodline that gave the Du ponts their occult power *end* Anne’s bloodline may possibly tie in to the House of David *end* At any rate Samuel and Anne’s son was
the first du Pont to rise to greatness and the first du Pont that can be connected directly to the
Illuminati *end* Samuel and Anne’s son was Pierre Samuel du Pont *end* Later Pierre Samuel added de
Nemours to his name to prevent confusion between him andther French legislatures named Dupont *end* Pierre Samuel du Pont was a ge nius *end* Pierre’s mother taught him to be a medium with spirits but
early on Pierre had to deny it publicly *end* His father Samuel could not understand the boy’s genius such
as his ability at age  to translate Greek and Latin at sight *end* When Pierre’s mother died when he was
 be no longer had a parent in the family who could understand him and after getting one of his
frequent beatings from his father he ran away and was spared near starvation by his Uncle Pierre de

Monchantin *end* Initiatially Pierre was a watchmaker But within a short time he attracted the attention
of several top Illuminati for his ability to write good tracts and articles that advocated various
economic and political views that they wanted promoted *end* Pierre Joined the Freemasons and at some
point was illuminized as most of the French lodges became *end* Although Pierre went through severe
financial difficulties after the French Revolution be regularly made payments to Masonic
organizations in France *end* Besides being friends with all the famous Masons of the time one Mason
brother of his worthy of note is the french astronomer Lalande who helped hide him during the
revolution *end* Someone very powerful protected Pierre Samuel during the French Revolution this is
hinted at by historian Pierre Jolly although Jolly never gives his protector’s name *end* I believe he was
protected because DuPont was part of the Inner Satanic hierarchy *end* He was also protected by the
daughter of Swiss financier Jacques Necker *end* This daughter was Madame Germalne de Staël *end* The
Madame was a close friend of Pierre Samuel and she operated a famous salon/cathouse *end* Madame de
Staël was nothing less than an intimate friend of St *end* Simon *end* She shared his occult revolutionary ideas *end* Henri de St *end* Simon was a student and friend of Jacques Rigomer-Bazin who was associated with the
Inner circle of several occult-based revolutionary groups during Pierre du Pont’s time in France *end* St *end* SImon was the author of The New Christianity which  foreshadowed the creation of international
communism *end* He also wrote in the early s The Globe and The Reorganization of the European
Community laying out ideas and plans for European unity *end* In the early ’s the Saint-Simonians
suggested in the early ’s that the date  be the target date for the New Order *end* In order to
rearrange the world into the New Order a number of items and stages needed to occur *end* Two canals-
one through the Suez and one through Panama were needed they said to create "Interdependence"
between the nations *end* They also suggested a high dam on the Nile *end* They suggested the technological
transformation of the earth and the biological creation of a new androgynous humanoid *end* Androgynous beings are being produced in underground facilities-they are the small greys used to
fly the saucers *end* Progress would be brought about by a series of revolutions *end* Study from Fire in The
Minds of Men by James H *end* Billington to understand how the occult fraternities have created all the
revolutions since the French revolution *end* St *end* Simon an Illuminatus wanted to have a child with
Madame de Stall which would become the anti-Christ *end* It didn’t happen but anyway it is significant
that the person who personally intervened during the French Revolution and saved Pierre Samuel
DuPont’s life was Madame de Staël *end* Necker along with Lafayette would later loan DuPont large sums
of money for him try out his schemes in business and in forming a communist society *end* It’s interesting
that the Physiocrats journal was Les Ephémérides du Citoyen The title has astrological occult
undertones *end* On Jan *end*   Pierre Samuel DuPont took over the journal’s management *end* He became a
key leader in France advocating a new order *end* Pierre Samuel DuPont believed in Plato’s idea of
government which included a philosopher-king *end* Pierre Samuel was deist *end* He spoke of "God" but he
meant nature’s deistic God not a personal God *end* He believed nature was a higher God than his
mechanical deist "God" *end* Notice the Jefferson in the Declaration of Independence also wrote
nature’s God" *end* This is because the deists like Jefferson and Du Pont believed Nature was the highest
God *end* The ambiguity of meaning has permitted people to think Jefferson was referring the Christian
God in the Declaration of Independence *end* It is a common occurrence that Christians assume that others
who use words that they use think like the Christians *end* Even today many New Agers have an easy
task to snow Christians *end* For instance they just say "I believe in Christ." The Masonic reference book
 *end* Famous Freemasons put out by the Missouri Lodge of Research provides this about Pierre
Samuel DuPont "When  he published two pamphlets on finances which attracted the attention of
the celebrated Quesnay *end* He then expounded the doctrines of Quesnay’s school "the physiocrats."
Went to Poland in  at the request of King Stanislaus-Augustus a Freemason to organize a
general system of national education *end* When Turgot became comptroller-general of French finances
DuPont was named inspector-general of commerce....He was recalled by Vergennes to assist in
negotiating with England the treaty to accord independence to the U.S *end* in  he was a member of
the States *end* General but his reactionary views led to his imprisonment in  ... *end* In  he
emigrated to the U.S *end* with his family and at Jefferson’s request started on a plan for national
education in this country *end* He returned to France in  and was instrumental in promoting the treaty
of  by which Louisiana was sold to the U.S."

Pierre Samuel was a key figure in attempts to create a national education system in both Poland and
the new U.S *end* A national education system was a Masonic/illuminati goal to control education and
take it out of the hands of sincere Christians *end* Jefferson who was a Grand Orient Mason of the famous
Nine Sisters Lodge and apparently a key Illuminatus was a close friend of Pierre Samuel and was
instrumental at several key points in Pierre Samuel’s life when he needed help *end* Jefferson arranged for
the first gunpowder order which was a government order when the Du Ponts went into the
gunpowder business *end* Benjamin Franklin a key leader of several secret occult fraternal groups was
also a close friend of Pierre Samuel *end* When Benjamin Franklin arrived Dec *end*  in France one of the
first people who sought out to visit with was Pierre Samuel DuPont *end* During the next year after that
DuPont was a frequent visitor to Franklin’s residence in the village of Passy *end* In  DuPont
expected to sit with Franklin at the treaty table in Paris but John Adams got the Americans to sign a
treaty with Britian without France’s involvement *end*
Alexander Hamilton whose role in the conspiracy is now known was DuPont’s lawyer in the U.S *end*
THE NEXT GENERATION

During the second year of Pierre Samuel’s marriage to Made Le Dèe Victor Made was born with the
Marquis de Mirabeau as his godfather *end* Victor Marie Du Pont - was an aide-de-camp to
Illuminatus Lafayette from - *end* Whether Victor was a Mason in France before the family
came to the United States in  I do not know *end* Victor Marie DuPont soon got involved in
Freemasonry in the United States after arriving *end* The following are some of the highlights to his secret
Masonic career according to Masonic records *end*
·-signed a masonic petition to create a lodge at Angelica NY

·--joined Washington Lodge No *end*  of Delaware

·-joined Knights Templars of Wilmington Del *end*
·-Grand Marshall of the Grand Lodge of Delaware also

·--Grand Treasurer of the Grand Lodge of Delaware

Pierre Samuel had two more sons- Paul François died at age  month and Eleuthère lrénée *end* Eleuthère lrénée followed his father’s steps in getting Illuminated *end* Eleuthère lrénée was a prominent
outspoken Jacobin *end*
THE JACOBINS

The Duc d’Orleans Grand Master of the Grand Orient of France that is head of all the French
masons along with two other key Masons Talleyrand and Mirabeau started the Jacobins *end* According
to the book The War of the Antichrist with the Church a book made from the lectures of George
Dillon Dublin Ireland M.H *end* Gill & Son  where Dillon lectures on the French Revolution he
states that both Talleyrand and Mirabeau were key Illuminati *end* The name of the original lodge of the
Jacobins was changed to Club Breton and then Jacobin Club *end* The Jacobins were basically an
illuminized type of Freemasonry *end* The President of the Jacobin Club was the Freemason Georges
Jacques Danton who was a member of the famous and powerful Nine Sisters Lodge nine sisters or
nine muses is what the Pleiades is called *end* Lafayette was a Jacobin as well as the key players in the
French Revolution *end* A very secret body of  key Freemasons ruled France secretly during this
period according to the Autobiography of Wolfe Tone pub *end* by R *end* Barry O’Brien  *end* Robespierre
was both a Freemason and an illuminatus *end* In fact he was both a disciple of Weishaupt and Rousseau *end* Prussian Baron Anacharsis Clootz was also a Freemason and illuminatus *end* He also was a disciple of
Weishaupt and understood better what Weishaupt was trying to accomplish *end* If one studies what these
men taught you will discover it is what was later known as Socialism and communism *end* The original
idea for all the French Revolution started with the Satanic hierarchy *end* In Nov *end*  the true colors of
this Satanic inspired business can be seen in the campaign against religion where anyone who was a

priest in France was killed and the Illuminati posted one of Its motto’s in public "Death is an eternal
sleep." Eyewitnesses testify that Satan has a very detailed plan which he entrusts to his very select
few at the top *end* Much of what seems coincidence and unrelated is actually according to a yery clever
diabolical plan *end* Eleuthère lrénée Du Pont was a major printer for the Jacobins *end* He was a convinced
Deist and worshipped nature too *end*
A POWDERMAN BECOMES DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL BANK

Later in the United States after successfully setting up the best gunpowder factory in the world
Eleuthère Irenée DuPont was selected along with his friend Nicholas Biddle to be a director of
Hamilton’s creation the United States Bank *end* Remember that Astor was also selected as a director of
this "National" Bank *end*
The Mason Stephen Girard - initiated into Masonry in  in Charleston S.C *end* helped
establish the second Bank of United States in  and served as its director *end* Girard had amassed a
S millIon fortune by the time of his death *end* He was born in France and become a sea captain *end* Where
his money came from is somewhat of a mystery *end* He gave large sums of his money to masonic charity *end*
EARLY YEARS IN AMERICA

On Jan *end*   the DuPont tribe arrived in the United States with grandiose plans *end* Part of the plans
were to create a new society *end* While

Victor Marie and his father pursued grandiose schemes that tailed miserably Eleuthère lrénée DuPont
started a gunpowder business in Delaware *end* Irénée’s success can be attributed to several factors

·The french government gave him top secret machinery and plans to produce the best gunpowder
possible in that day *end* It was state-of-the-art technology and they supplied manpower to help get
started *end*
·The DuPonts had friends in various places that helped them in numerous ways getting financing
business land etc *end*
·Eleuthère lrénée DuPont was intelligent worked very hard and worked with patience *end* If he hadn’t
had so many commendable qualities then the Du Pont family may have sunk back in history and
another family taken their place *end*
A ROYAL DYNASTY

The DuPont’s are a dynasty of Kings *end* They have been called Kings- and rightly so even if people
have been unaware that they are a dynasty of Illuminati Kings *end* I do not know which particular men
have served during the Satanic rituals *end* The famIly has always had a head of the family *end* It may be that
the most powerful DuPont may also secretly serve as the highest Satanist *end* I don’t know who has been
representing the family at the highest levels of secret Satanism I suspect or surmise it has not been
the public head of the family in modern times but I can list the public head of the family as it passed
down through time

Persons below --years as head of family-- generation coming to America

Pierre Samuel Dupont- -- first

Eleuthère lrénée DuPont- ---second

Alfred Victor DuPont- -third Henry DuPont- ---third

Henry A *end* DuPont- - -fourth

These men had great authority over the tribe of duPonts *end* The du Ponts had family council where even
the women had voting rights *end* The DuPonts like the Rothschilds helped set up their children’s
marriages and many of the early ones were to cousins *end* For instance much to the delight of the
duPonts Sophie Madeleine du Pont married her cousin Samuel Prancis DuPont in  *end*  of
Sophie’s drawing occur later in this article *end* The family owned everything in common and
distributed according to needs and according to the contribution that each could give to the family
business *end* The James Bidderman the son of Evelina DuPont Bidderman went to France and his
decedents would give the DuPonts a lineage in France *end* One of the families that Intermarried and were
close friends with the DuPonts was the Cazenoves family *end* Both families were close friends with
Thomas Jefferson and Albert Gallatin I have concluded that both Thomas Jefferson and Albert
Gallatin were Illuminati *end* Further I discovered in a forty volume set on American Statesmen in vol *end*  p *end* that Albert Gallatin claimed to be descended from the ancient Roman Consul Callatinus *end* Incredible as it may seem the black nobility have kept track of their bloodlines *end* The same people
ruling the world today are in many ways the descendants of the rulers in past ages *end* Antoine Charles
Cazenove born in Geneva Sw *end* was a business partner with Albert Gallatin *end* During the War of
the DuPont gunpowder factory since it was the primary American powder company was the known
target for the British to destroy *end* However the British never attacked it *end* The Du Ponts had organized a
local militia called the Brandywine Rangers *end* Interestingly their militia flag was a beehive on white
silk *end* Lafayette visited the DuPonts in Delaware the summer of  *end*

Another important Mason who would visit the DuPonts was Henry Clay who was the American
Secretary of State and head of the whig party *end* Henry Clay was Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of
Kentucky and GranD Orator for the G.L *end* - *end* He was one of the Freemasons involved in a high
level meeting that used the U.S *end* Senate Chambers on Mar *end*   for their meeting *end* If the duPonts
were already one of the primary top families it may well be Clay was coming to them for guidance
on how to steer the nation *end* The duPonts played a role too in the building of the American capital
which was laid out and constructed with numerous occult patterns *end*
THE NEXT GENERATION--Pierre Samuel’s grandchildren

Eleuthère lrénée du Pont had a daughter Sophie Madeleine du Pont - *end* Sophie was also her
mothers name *end* Sophie Madeleine du Pont her name Sophie/Sophia is popular with Moriah wrote
diaries journal voluminous correspondence *end* Sophie also drew hundreds are drawings and sketches
many of them charactures of people *end* Of her sketches this article reproduces two of them which bear
importance to this newsletter *end* The first is a drawing by Sophie du Pont of one of the duPonts dressed
up like Satan with long paper horns and a tail *end* Interestingly according to a // letter by
Sophie to one of her relatives Sophie comments that the costume of Satan was mistaken "for Old
Nick." See the article on Saturn in this newsletter for evidence of the connection between Satan and
Santa *end* The next drawing is a drawing that went with a letter from Sophie to Clementina Smith
July  which is a self-portrait of what Sophie calls "blackies" black servants who "toted"
carried her to her bath in a special chair *end* This drawing is included to show how wealthy the DuPonts
were within a short time after coming to Delaware U.S.A *end* Alfred Victor DuPont who took over as
head of both the family and the factories making gunpowder was married to Meta *end* Meta was into
Swedenborgianism which was a type of mystical religious Freemasonry that was based on the
swedish mason Swedenborg’s teachings *end* Alfred Victor apparently didn’t feel anything negative
toward this *end* His wife Meta organized a Swedenborg church in town *end* Around the CIvil War times the
DuPonts became less identified with Deism and more Identified with the Episcopal church *end* Joanna
Smith DuPont was Instrumental in this change *end* One of the families that the DuPonts would marry
with was the Cazenoves who were Episcopalians and some members were I suspect involved with
the Illuminati *end* Christ Church was built off the DuPont communal property for Episcopal services *end* By
the Civil War the state of Delaware was lock-stock-and-barrel under the control of the DuPonts and
their friends the Bayards the Saulsburys and the Greys in this  century the DuPonts have gotten
firmer control *end* Because the state of Delaware is controlled by the DuPonts et *end* al it is worthwhile to
examine some of the people the DuPonts and their elite friends have placed into office *end* This is a very
unfinished skimpy list I have done only a little research in this direction *end*

companies *end* I suggest that everyone who believes that the DuPonts and the rest of the elite are
capitalists should take another look at history *end* These men do not believe in capitalism they believe in
monopolies--which boils down to the same thing that occurs under communism *end* When these people
described their setting up a monopoly they call it "bringing order and stability to a fragmented and
chaotic industry." In  Alfred I *end* du Pont attempted to bribe French officers in charge of the
production of smokeless gunpowder to give the secrets to him *end* But no amount of bribe would work
as the Frenchmen knew they would lose thefr lives if they gave the secrets to him *end* The British were
not any more helpful *end* Ufe was not all peaches and cream *end* Fred was murdered *end* William du Pont
- was trapped in a marriage with a duPont cousin May du Pont that he ditn’t want to be
married to *end* Louis Cazenove du Pout a handsome intelligent young - committed suicide with a bullet
in the library at the Wilmington Club *end* Alfred was shot in the face by accident on a hunting trip *end* The
duPont family had their share of heartaches broken marriages insanity etc *end* When Mary Belin
married into the family she brought some Jewish blood *end* As a major part of the budding military
industrial complex the DuPonts during the  century had to work with the army and navy *end* The
army and navy convinced them to Implement a contract with the Coopal Co *end* in Belgium for
smokeless powder which when the formula was received was found to be inferior to what the
American were already producing *end* However this whole episode ended with the DuPonts going with
their own formula and setting up a new plant at Carney’s Point New Jersey *end* This hits the highlights
of the family history in their first  years in this nation *end* To celebrate their first hundred years every
living descendent of the first Pierre Samuel was invited to a great banquet *end* A building was built to
house them *end* They numbered over  *end* At each person’s table setting was a special gift of a gold coin
prepared especially to commemorate this centennial *end* On Jan *end*   the DuPont tribe celebrated *end* The DuPonts are shrouded in so much secrecy that their secrecy is not even known *end* When Eugene
DuPont the chief executive of the family gunpowder/high explosive business died near the turn of the
century none of the other DuPonts hardly even a vague idea of how much the company was worth or
what assets it had *end* At that time the DuPonts had powder plants in PA DEL Iowa and TN *end* The
DuPonts are much the same today except that their assets are perhaps ten times better hidden not
only from outsiders but from themselves *end* The DuPonts have in general made their money the hard
way-by working and producing in contrast to the other top families *end* The DuPonts are to be
commended on this even If at times they have been very tight on what they have given their workers *end* The DuPonts have also shown an amazing ability to keep their dynasty alive *end* There seems to be an
increasing invisibility to their family *end*
HITTING PAYDIRT

One of the people who bad been Involved for a short time with the Illuminati and is now a Christian
told me that they could remember the name The Society of the Cincinnati and that they knew nothing
about the organization but that it had something to do with the Illuminati *end* But what is this
organization *end*
Without anything but the name I began my investigation *end* At first look it seemed like some old ladles
genealogy group who are descendents of revolutionary soldiers *end*
However as I carried out what promised to be a long term research project on the Society it began to
appear that something big was behind this organization *end* One reference stated "The Society of the
Cincinnati #  # it is likely that no Englishman feels a greater sense of pride in being a Knight of
the Garter or Scotsman a Knight of the Thistle than an American feels in being a member of The
Society of the Cincinnati." WOW *end* DOUBLE WOW *end* Here is an organization that essentially no one I
know has even heard about and yet an American would feel a great sense of pride in belonging to it *end* Interesting *end* Not only that but I knew what the Order of the Garter is! *end* The Order of the Garter is the
secret inner group which is an elite group within the Order of St *end* John of Jerusalem which is the
British part of the Knights of Malta *end* The Knights of the Garter are the leaders of the Committee of
 *end* They are diabolical men *end* Lord Peter Carrington who is a member of the satanic Order of Osiris
and other demonic groups is a member of the Order of the Garter *end* Lord Palmerston is an example
from history of another similar example of a KnIght of the Garter who was totally corrupt pretended
to be a Christian and practiced Satanism *end* I found out that the Massachusetts legislature had had some
of its senators and representatives concerned for the welfare and safety of the United States because
according to testimony on record the Society of Cincinnati was "the beginning of a hereditary
aristocracy in the U.S *end* dedicated to subverting the Republic." The Massachusetts Legislature declared
the Society of the Cincinnati "dangerous." And yet speaking for the public for all the legislators
trouble the truth is nobody has even heard of the Society of the CIncinnati let alone known or
guessed it was dangerous *end*
When the United States was created it operated under the Articles of Confederation *end* It was a
confederation of Independent states-each of the states printed their - money passed their own laws
etc *end* The federal government was simply a League of Nations-type body *end* The Society of the
Cincinnati was partly responsible for getting that changed *end* The Society of Cincinnati favored a very
strong central government a national bank etc *end* The Freemason Baron von Steuben is credited with
starting the organization *end* The Mason Pierre L’Enfant who designed the CIty of Washington with its
hidden occult symbols also designed the logo for the Society of the Cincinnati *end* Every president of the
United States has worn the Diamond Eagle jewell of the Society of the Cincinnati *end* Wow *end* And I
hadn’t even heard about it until I got this tip from this ex-illuminatus *end* Benjamin Franklin was an
honorary member *end* The Marquis de Lafayette was a member *end* George Washington and James Monroe
were Original Members *end* At least  Presidents have been honorary members *end* Pres *end* Franklin Pierce
and Zachery Taylor his father was an Original Member were hereditary members *end* Many of the high
ranking Masons who were also officers in the Revolution were Original Members *end* Three prominent
Freemasons who were big in the Society of the Cincinnati were Henry Beekman Livingston -
 James Mann - and Hardy Murfee - *end* Hardy served as Grand Master of
the Grand Lodge of North Carolina beginning in  *end* I noticed that many very busy elite People
were spending a lot of money and time on this Society whatever its purpose was *end* The Society had a
museum and a headquarters building in Washington D.C *end* on Massachusetts Ave N.W *end* and state
chapters *end* But why *end* The stated purpose of the organization ditn’t seem to explain the interest people
put into the organization *end* Why spend time belonging to an organization whose only purpose is to
commemorate the fact that all Its members are descendents of Revolutionary War officers *end* The
purpose of the organization is "To render permanent the cordial affection subsisting among the
officers." O.K *end* I can understand a group of officers who are all veterens of a war getting together *end* But
their descendents *end* We are talking about a war whose fighting basically ended in  *end* That’s over
 years ago *end* Would my busy descendents care to visit with some other Vietnam vets’ great-great-
great grandchildren  years from now *end* Yet my  World Almanac which lists in fine print
about  associations gives the membership of the Society of the Cincinnati at  *end* Other
sources indicated that the organization had an affiliate organization in France *end* But how *end* How could
an organization which was open to only descendents of select Revolutionary Officers be so Identical
in purpose to something in France for frenchmen *end* I could understand why but only If the stated
purposes were not the whole story *end* As you can see I was very suspicious of the Society of the
Cincinnati it appears I had stumbled onto something big *end* But I hadn’t been able to tie the Society in
with the Illuminati-until I stepped up my research on the duPonts *end* The tie-in between the Illuminati
and the Society of the Cincinnati came when I began investigating what I thought might turn out to be
an obscure Person *end* His name was Leighton Coleman -? *end* and he was married to Francis

Fanny Elizabeth daughter of Alexis Irenée du Pont - *end* Alexis died in an accident *end* Occult
bloodline power can pass through women or men so it was worth it to investigate Leighton Coleman *end* Leighton Coleman turned out to be the Bishop of the State of Delaware for the Episcopal Church *end* He
was a prime mover in the temperence movement which I had already discovered was Illuminati
controlled *end* Further Leighton was grand chaplain of the Grand Lodge of Freemasons in
Pennslyvannia Grand Prelate of the Knights Templar and chaplain of the Delaware Society of the
Cincinnati *end* Another of the top  Illuminati families is the Kennedy family *end* There is a connection to
the Society of the Cincinatti with this family too *end* Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis ex-wife to
both J.F.K *end* and Aristotie Onassis had a grandfather named Major Bouvier who invented a family
genealogy which was mostly fiction which was self-published in  as Our Forebears but tbe
fantasy Bouvier genealogy allowed him and his sons Bud and Black Jack to get into The Society of
the Cincinnati *end* see A Woman Named Jackie by C *end* David Heymann p *end*  All three Bouviers were
very proud of their memberships and would proudly display their boutonnieres on their labels
showing membership *end*
THE THREE COUSINS THAT SAVED THE DUPONT COMPANY IN

The successful three Du Ponts Alfred Coleman and Pierre that together took over the gunpowder
factories ended up in some serious infighting after a few years *end* Alfred divorced his wife to marry his
cousin and the Coleman and many of the others did not approve of the marriage *end* Alfred and the
others got Into some serious family infighting *end* In  Alfred at one point letting his rage get the
better of him got the Delaware legislature to pass a special law changing his first wife’s sons name to
spite his first wife *end* The special law passed the House in four hours secretly at Alfred’s request but
failed by two votes in the Senate after the other Du Ponts found out what Alfred was trying *end* Alfred
built his cousin-wife Alicia the most expensive house on the east coast *end* In  dollars the lowest
estimate is  million but the actual cost may easily have been several times that *end* The name of the
mansion was named Nemours *end* The main grounds of the Nemours estate are  acres enclosed by an

corruption of Coleman DuPont’s forces *end* Up to that time politics and voting *end* and vote counting were
totally corrupt *end* By April  Alfred had defeated Coleman for control of Delaware’s politics *end* In
 Alfred bought the principle daily paper in the area the Wilmington Morning News *end* In
after successfully blocking his uncle Henry A *end* duPont from being reelected Alfred duPont bought
control of  Delaware newspapers *end* in  on a trip to Egypt Alfred found a dog be named Mummy
that was his familiar spirit *end* In the biography about Alfred which I read it said "Alfred had scored over
his sister Marguerite *end* Let her collect Virginia ghosts if she wanted them *end* Only he had a reincarnated
Egyptian mascot who could produce wonders as great as those of Aladdin’s genie." Alfred Du Pont
by Joseph F *end* Wail p *end*  Alfred L du Pont himself wrote this in a letter to the Rev *end* Baker P *end* Lee
May ‘ about his familiar spirit "I have one or two more jobs for Mummy and then I will give her a
vacation before I put her to work again." He wrote at least one other letter where he talks about the
magical powers of his dog *end* which was his familiar spirit *end* Mrs *end* Cazenove Lee Jr *end* got a letter

powerful man in Florida *end* Ed Bali’s wealth passed the Billion dollar mark in the s or s *end* In the late

investigation of the misuse of his money hidden in the foundations *end* In  Ed Bail died *end* in  Ed
Ball’s widow claimed that Ed’s sister Jessie had actually murdered Alfred I *end* duPont in  *end* She
claimed that while Ed was alive she had been too afraid to tell the truth about Alfred’s murder *end* Forbes
magazine carried the story in Oct *end*  *end* T *end* Coleman duPont went in business with President Taft’s
brother Charles P *end* member of the Skull & Bones in  to build McAlpin Hotel in New York City *end* Taft’s other brother Horace was a member of the Order of Skull and Bones *end* In fact the Taft family
which dates back to Braintree Mass *end* in  helped start the Skull & Bones Order and at least eight
Tafts have been in the Order *end* This was the first of a series of luxury hotels *end* Coleman bought New
York Equitable Life Assurance Society which was America’s largest insurance company *end* N.Y *end*
Equitable Life Assurance company undoubtedly brought Coleman in touch with other Illuminati elite *end* He belonged to the Rittenhouse in Philadelphia *end* He was the director of a number of things including
the Union National Bank in Wilmington and the pres *end* of Central Coal & Iron Co *end* along with a few
other coal and Iron companies *end* T *end* Coleman has been mentioned already in connection to the Du Pont
Gunpowder Business which he ran for a number of years as head honcho *end* During W.W *end*  the Du

absorbed General Motors *end* The DuPonts also went Into the chemical business *end* The american
government had seized the German Dye Trust and the DuPonts were given their patents *end* The Du
Ponts began to build a great chemical empire on the synthetic such as shatterproof glass paints
rayon nylon dyes photographic flim rubber chemicals drugs etc *end* Only the Dow Chemical
Company is any competition with the DuPont chemical operation *end* Alfred Victor duPont Alfred I.’s
son served only as a private in the marines during W.W *end* I and was on board several ships *end* And yet
for some reason when W.W *end*  broke out he was made a consultant to the Joint Chiefs of Staff from

Emile Francis duPont -  graduated from Yale like a number of duPonts have *end* He was
important lay person within the Episcopal church *end* Pierre Samuel duPont belonged to the American

what drugs will do to a person which le an area of his research *end* And Francis Marguerite du Pont
born  in Duluth Minn *end* is deep into research into genetics *end* Those of us who know what these
people want to do cringe when we see that some of the top genetic researchers are connected with
Satanic families *end* Every American almost everyday uses a Du Pont product *end* When I began learning
what the DuPont industries produce it is utterly astonishing *end* Anything that involves chemicals is
under their production *end* Herbivores and fertilizers for farming *end* cosmetics and nylons for women
chemicals for all types of industrial production textiles of all kinds cleaning fluids such as when you
clothes are dry cleaned *end* The list can go on and on *end* Most of us are using DuPont products almost
continuously all through the day *end* General Motors the explosives and gunpowder monopoly the
chemical monopoly which its tens of thousands of products gives the duPonts enormous financial
leverage *end* The DuPonts obviously are in close cooperation with the elite involved with oil-because so
many of their products are derivatives of petroleum products *end* In  it was estimated the duPont
famIly was worth  billion *end* Today their total worth must be many billions of dollars not to mention
the enormous power they wield *end* The very survival of the United States military is dependent upon the
military products of the DuPonts *end*
THE DUPONT COMPANY USED AS A TOOL TO BRING US INTO THE NEW ORDER

Although the DuPont companies -the principle DuPont company is E.L *end* DuPont De Nemours & Co
whose  revenues were  *end* billion- are run by many executives who are not duPonts the
duPont family does quietly pull the strings in the background *end* Many of the executives are men whose
philosophy of life matches the duPonts *end* It is very clear that the DuPont companies are being used in a
big way to move us toward the New World Order *end* The first item on this concerns how the Du Pont
workers are being Indoctrinated *end* I received a video of the Pecos River Training near Santa Fe N.M *end* that DuPont workers in the east are sent to *end* I also looked at a magazine article about this training
indoctrination in the article "Go Take A Flying Leap for the company" Successful Meetings June
 pp.- *end* A christian brother who works for the DuPonts in Tennessee has been secretly
undermining the efforts of the DuPont company leaders to turn the workers into New Agers *end* With the
help of Christians in the plant this Christian brother finds out what is planned and then does his
homework so that he can proof to the workers how New Age ideas are being brought in to subvert
their thinking *end* The company changed from calling all its people "employees" to calling them initiates *end*
The people at the plant were to all be sent to the Pecos River Training by DuPont but due to the
exposure of their New Age subversion people are not allowing themselves to be led by the nose *end* This
brother sent me a video of the Pecos River Training *end* and there are scenes in it where "strangers" are
kissing each other-well not exactly strangers because the training is designed to break down
individuality and to create a group think with intimacy *end* Initiates are taught don’t slay the ego ego is
your servant." Another magazine article in June  p- tells about the five type of thinking
that the DuPont company is trying to instill in their people *end* They are  *end* lateral thinking;  *end* metaphoric
thinking;  *end* posItive thinking this is also called visualization-or in the occult witchcraft;  *end* assocIation trigger;  *end* rapturing and interpreting dreams *end* An employee environmental awards
program was installed where employees can win money by submitting their environmental
suggestions *end* Personal Journal Aug *end*  pp - *end* Many of the readers of this newsletter are already
aware of how the environmental issue is contrived and controlled by the elite *end* One of the items our
new-agy Dept *end* of Education secretary Alexander tried to get going was for education to shift from the
schools to the factories *end* This is a process that the Illuminati want to implement to further take us into
a total slave state *end* Interestingly DuPont has been getting into the act by spearheading Delaware’s
BRT task force in which students will attend seminars at Du Pont facilities *end* The DuPont company is
employing A.A.-that is artificial intelligence *end* The neural networks are to the point they can learn from
their mistakes *end* DuPont is taking us into Brave New Worid *end* They were the first ones to initiate with
Fax NOW a rapid customer service called fax-on-demand *end* Du Pont is now in the process of becoming
totally global *end* They already have plants in a number of South American countries Mexico Canada
US *end* Korea Japan; and several european nations *end* They have been trying to figure out how to enter the
Commonwealth of Independent States CIS--what used to be USSR *end* Apparently they lost some
money already in that regards *end* The ICI Imperial Chemical Industries- which is allied with the
Warburg family in England and DuPont swapped plants *end* Imperial Chemical Industries has had their
headquarters in Wilmington Del for some time before this swap *end* DuPont got ICI nylon plant and ICI
got DuPont acrylic plant in the states *end* Why *end* So both companies could become more international *end* Or
in the words of someone else to "focus resources on businesses where each can develop stronger
global positions." See Economist // p *end* The swap will give DuPont % of the European
market for nylon fibers used to manufacture carpets *end*
Dupont has built a -million research center in Bad Homburg Ger *end* DuPont has been spending
according to a recent article  *end* billion on research *end* Some of Du Pont’s research la in "risky" areas
that means that it is difficult to see how the research can financially benefit the company *end* ThIs has
been admitted by the company *end*
The Aviation Week and Space Technology // issue p *end*  talks about the sophisticated
composite materials that DuPont is producing for state of the art space and aviation vehicles *end* I
Imagine some of these composite materials are finding there way to the secret UFO bases and
DuPont may well be producing some of the parts for these secret anti-gravity machines *end* The article
states that Boeing Defense and Space Group Lockhead Aeronautical Systems Co *end* General Dynamics

are definitely involved with the production of flying saucers so this may be a good due that DuPont is
too *end* The article states that DuPont has been a leading supplier for advanced US military programs *end* An
example of the sophisticated materials that the DuPonts are producing is XTC; the first recyclable
class-A finish thermoplastic sheet molding compound for horizontal exterior body panels *end* It is a

to the open *end* One book said that th du Ponts were one of the top three influential famIlies in the United
States today *end* Whether one is aware of the secret Satanic power of the duPonts or not it is inescapable
to conclude that thi family is exceedingly powerful in the United States beyond comprehension *end* Every facet of our lives is influenced by products whose production is still ultimately under the
control of the duPont family of control *end* For those people who subscribe to the theory that the world is
divided between oni the Rothschilds and Rockefellers look at the duPonts who are truly independent
of the other top families dispels that theory *end* To quote Karl Schriftgiesser in his book Families "...the
Du Ponts of Delaware constitute a definite dynasty perhaps the most complete dynast ever establIshed
in this republic an one whIch seems destined to contintue its kingship for generations I come...Today
there are seven hundred members of thi family...Every time a package of cigarettes is opened the
simple tearing of the tab is a gesture of tribute to the Du Ponts and every time a great gun booms
with whatever cost to life or property; it echoes merrily in the feudal stronghold of this mighty
clan...We must end with the direct statement that the Du Ponts today rule Delaware with an Iron hand
that their interests affect the daily lives of each one of us in some way and that the Family moves on *end* "It is today the great American dynasty *end* Close unassailed it keeps to itself hides its scandals
boasts not of its good works but continues within American democracy to exert its own indomitable
way."

vibes that something was strange about Silverton OR *end* Later through my contacts I found out that

Silverton had some occult activity already there *end* About  to  mIles southeast of Silverton Or is

Skull & Bones Order wrote a long article in the Williamette Weekly about the Skull & Bones Order *end* John Lawrence and I would be a natural shoe-in as Mends since we both investigate secret satanic
groups *end* But the man who knew John Lawrence always told me after promising to get us together that
John had disappeared *end* Not only that but this man’s original openness turned to not wanting to have
much to do with me *end* touching some type of very sensitive secret *end* Here is what I have been able to
find out *end* Several satanic groups are in the Gates OR area *end* John Lawrence was extremely interested in
what the  of the Skull and Bones Society meant *end* He was convinced that number linked the Skull
& Bones society with other groups *end* John Lawrence and  other researchers like himself moved to
Mill City to investigate the secret satanic groups in the area *end* From someone from the inside it turns
out that the CIA shot two of those researchers while they were in the Mill City area investigating *end* The
CIA went looking for John Lawrence *end* And John Lawrence is now in hiding *end* People in the Mill City
area were afraid to answer my questions *end* However I was able to glean a little information with a
great deal of effort *end* Some occult group bought a ranch near Gates OR *end* The head of the group is Jim

activity was over five years ago and it appears that the Satanists are in the key positions in the Mill
City and Gates *end* They may even have a person on the police force *end* The last obvious item to comment
on is that for some reason the CIA is very mixed up and sensitive about this occult activity *end* John

Lawrence was One reaction to my duPont article was that someone whose mother-in-law works for
the duPonts in Pennsylvannia asked a few questions and found out that her mother-in-law is an actual
witch I don’t mean as in an old hag--I mean is in witchcraft *end* This witch is close friends of the
duPonts and has been protected from being fired by the duPonts *end* What is most significant in this
whole thing to me is that my article got other people cognizant of what happening so that they could
teach themselves *end* Once people begin to reaily catch on to things they will begin to detect things all
around that are happening in regards to the NWO *end* Most Americans don’t have any frame of reference
to hang any facts about the conspiracy *end* They bemoan the idea of a Satanic conspiracy they claim
there is no proof all the while it is all around them *end* For instanced did anyone catch what Bill Clinton
did when he faced the people and waved at the inauguration *end* See the last article in this newsletter for
an answer *end* A friend called my attention to Inside Edition’s television story on Lewis Dupont Smith
the heir to the  million fortune of the Du Pont Chemical Co *end* Lewis Dupont Smith is exposing his
family *end* Of course on national television which is controlled by the Illuminati they are not going to do
much exposing-but they did let a few hints get through *end* Lewis Dupont Smith did get a sentence left in
what was shown on T.V *end* where he points the finger it "powerful families" as the culprits behind the
drug trade *end* The reason be was allowed to voice this was that Lewis was the person behind the book
Dope Inc *end* and it was this involvement that got him in hot trouble with his family *end* Lyndon LaRouche
who was truly exposing the Satanic conspiracy wrote a good book Dope Inc *end* The book exposes the
Queen of England is a participant in the drug trade *end* Yes the british royal famIly does tie in the elite
the occult and the drug trade *end* They are not as nice is their pictures suggest *end* Lewis Dupont Smith
having a good feel for what is going on recognized that Dope Inc *end* is the as be put it paraphrased
"The only book showing the involvement of powerful families." Lewis provided the  for the
book to be printed *end* Good for him *end* Let’s just make it plain the Satanic hierarhy is behind the drug
problem *end* Lewis’ family was very upset that he was helping the enemy and they got a judge to rule
that Lewis was incompetent to handle his financial affairs and the court declared that Lewis can have

Lewis from getting captured and taken  miles into the Atlantic on his father’s yacht to be tortured

Illuminati families owns justice in this country *end* He failed to get his family on the conspiracy charge *end*
One detail that I didn’t mention in the original story on the duPonts was the one of the more recent
Governors of Delaware C *end* Douglas Buck was married to Alice H *end* duPont *end* I also left out a great deal
of the inside story on the politicking that has gone on in Delaware this century *end* It is so detailed with
so many names that I didn’t want to confuse people with it *end* Anyway the bottom line is that behind
the scenes all of the Governors since the s have been approved by the duPonts *end* I debated
whether to include the du Ponts genealogy *end* I had it so I decided to give it on the chance someone
might use it *end* The genealogy shows several things a *end* that the duPonts like the Astors repeatedly used
the same names over and over b that the duPonts like the Rothschilds had a lot of first cousin
marriages marriages between a du Pont and a du Pont are given asterisks-however some of the
marriages between people with different last names are also between flrst cousins and other relation *end* If it looks like I’ve gone to a great deal of trouble for nothing-I can understand what you’re saying *end* We certainly don’t need to know every du Pont *end* But just like in a laboratory one deals with many
exact small details in numerous experiments to discover a principle-that is what I am doing here *end* I am
trying to break ground so that people will understand more about how the elite think etc *end* I had hoped
that I might also be able to track which branches are with the Illuminati and which may have balled

Bloodlines of Illuminati

By

Fritz Springmeier

The Freeman Bloodline

The amazing thing about this family is that it is not a family that people would have thought of as
being one of the top thirteen; however for me as a researcher of the elite and the Satanic hierarchy
the name pops up with surprising frequency *end* For instance Stephen M *end* Freeman runs the Legal Affairs
Dept *end* of the Civil Rights Division of the Anti-Defamation League which is a daughter of the B’nai
B’rith *end* The ADL is a dangerous organization controlled by the hierarchy *end* The illuminati drug money
to fund this organization *end* Another Freeman is Walter Freeman who introduced the lobotomy into the
U.S *end* with James W *end* Watts in  *end* The frontal lobotomy was a brutal method of mind control that
has been permitted to be done to us under the disguise that it is of benefit to humanity *end* Then there
was Simon Freeman an important intelligence officer *end* And the list goes on of people that are in key
places with the Freeman name *end* But the most important position of all which removes all doubt that
the family is at the top is that the late Grand Master of the Prieure de Sion was Gaylord Freeman *end*
Independent discoverers of The PRIEURE DE SION

What is the Prieure de Sion *end* Are we sure it exists *end* How does this relate to the hierarchy *end* The Prieure
de Sion Priory of Zion was unknown to the general public until  when a book co-authored by
Michael Baigent Richard Leigh and Henry Lincoln came out *end* The book was entitled Holy Blood
Holy Grail and it offered historical proof that an organization called the Prieure de Sion was powerful
and had existed since the time of the early crusades  A.D. *end* In  I came out a little more
information on the Prieure de Sion *end* The organization is so little known to even my readership that we
need to stop and really examine the Prieure de Slon *end*
In trying to figure out the mysteries surrounding this organization Lincoln Leigh and Baigent’s
research led them to conclude that the holy bloodline that the Prieure de Sion guarded was the
bloodline of Jesus *end* This immediately made all their research anathema condemned and disliked by
the most of Christendom *end* I watched to see if Christians would refute the unbiblical parts of their
research but besides a couple of short articles Christian Century /-/ - "Raiders of the Lost
Grail" and Christianity Today // - "Holy Blood Holy Grail - holy mackerel" in Christian
periodicals in addition to this was a small book in England- The Holy Grail Revealed which
simplistically claimed that the book was of no value because obviously it was erroneous no one even
pretended to try to refute the book as far as I know except for that English book which did pretend
but didn’t refute anything *end* The authors went on to write two more popular historical exposes
concerning the Prieure de Sion and Freemasonry The Messianic Legacy and The Temple and The
Lodge *end* Actually to be fair to the Christians if I hadn’t already known from my research that much of
the European information in Holy Blood *end* Holy Grail was correct the wild religious speculation about
Jesus in Part  may have caused me to doubt the book too *end* The first Christian author to pick up on the
Prieure de Sion was J.R *end* Church who wrote Guardians of the Grail which built on Holy Blood *end* Holy
Grail’s research in a constructive way and put more pieces of the puzzle together *end* At last a book was
out that challenged some of the false ideas of Holy Blood Holy Grail without blindly throwing their
excellent research *end* While the public at large had never heard of the Prieure de Sion until Holy Blood *end* Holy Grail came out the organization was written about in high level military intelligence briefings
years before the book *end* Some of the men in high level intelligence have become concerned with the
direction this nation is going *end* It is through such men that independent confirmation had leaked out



even before the book *end* The information did get to some researchers *end* I came out with my Be Wise As
Serpents book in  which among other things covered the Prieure de Sion after I had concluded
that the evidence verified its existence *end*
I approached the issue from my own angle of research *end* In researching the Illuminati it became clear  *end* that bloodlines were very important  *end* that the people in high level Satanism believe they are
descendents of the House of David  *end* the Illuminati’s activities tied in in many ways to the Prieure de
Sion *end* One startling tie in was that the Freeman family was according to an informant one of the top
 Illuminati families *end* The ex-Illuminati people I received information from were not familiar with
Holy Blood Holy Grail nor Guardians of the Grail *end* Even if they had which they definitely hadn’t
neither book mentions the Freeman family *end* It wasn’t until the researchers of Holy Blood Holy Grail
wrote their sequel The Messianic Legacy that was published in  that the name Freeman came out
as the leader of the Prieure de Sion *end* In short the way the research of mine and others simoultaneously
from different angles came up independently with similar conclusions using totally different sources
confirms beyond a doubt that the Prieure de Sion exists and that the Freeman family is indeed a very
powerful family *end* I have never spelled out in detail nil the proofs about the Prieure de Sion and the
Freeman family and even now I am not going to *end* To me the basics are facts and I don’t want to get
bogged down trying to prove the obvious when there is so much more to learn *end* There are stubborn
people whose minds will not come along no matter how much proof and encouragement *end* They will
just have to stay where they are *end*
DESCRIBING THE PRIEURE DE SION

The original start of the Prieure de Sion appears to have been the idea of a number of powerful
bloodlines and included various descendents of the Merovingians including the House of Lorraine
the House of Guise the Medicis Sforzas the Estes the Gonzagas and the St *end* Clairs Sinclairs *end* The
Medicis are tied to the Black Nobility also *end* From the beginning the Prieure de Sion has been
committed to Hermetic Magic a type of black magic that originated with the ancient Egyptians and
portrayed in the Egyptian Book of the Dead *end* René d’ Anjou a descendent of the Merovingians
persuaded Cosimo de Medici to establish in c *end*  a non-church library at San Marco where Plato
Pythagorean works and books on Hermetic Magic were translated *end* Up until this time the Catholic
church had control of all the libraries *end* It was from Cosimo dé Medici’s library that the spark of Greek
and Egyptian teachings set off what developed into the Renaisannce which was revival of humanism
and the occult *end* It appears that during the Middle Ages witchcraft and the mystery religions had
seriously dissolved to the point that these modes of thought had to be relearned from the ancient
writings *end* Interestingly the Middle Ages when witchcraft and paganism were dissolving have been
branded the Dark Ages by the establishment and inaccurately painted as a time when learning
went out. *end* A magazine put out during W.W *end* II by Prieure de Sion members was Vaincre *end* The
organization that took credit for the magazine was Alpha Galates *end* It carried articles on Atlantis
theosophy Celtic wisdom and other esoteric things *end* The magazine also declared itself in favor of a
United Europe *end* Robert Schuman who was associated with the magazine Vaincre later become a
leading architect of the EEC *end* An internal magazine for Prieure de Sion members is CIRCUIT the
acronym for Chivalry of Catholic Rules and Institutions of the Independent and Traditionalist Union *end* A  issue of CIRCUIT promotes the use of a -sign zodiac rather than the traditional  *end* The
 series of CIRCUIT refer the reader toVaincre *end* The CIRCUIT magazine which claims to write its
articles with ‘hidden meaning says this cryptically about the Prieure de Sion "We are not strategists
and we stand above all religious denominations political perspectives and financial matters *end* We give
to those who come to us moral aid and the indispensible manna of the spirit." Another article says
"...except through new methods and new men for politics are dead *end* The curious fact remains that men
do not wish to recognize this *end* There exists only one question economic organization." Dr *end* Otto von
Hapsburg a descendent of the Merovingians and a Knights of Malta headed Pan-Europa an
organization that has been working toward a U.S *end* of Europe *end* Their logo was a Celtic cross in a circle *end* The first point in time that the Prieure de Sion can be pinpointed is when Jerusalem was captured by
the Crusaders and an abbey of monks that Peter the Hermit had belonged to was established in a
building called the Abbey of Notre Dame de Mont de Sion just outside of Jerusalem *end* This abbey had



an order that was called the Ordre de Sion *end* Over the centuries the Ordre de Sion has developed into
what we have today as the Prieure de Sion Priory of Zion in English *end* Bear in mind that the Ordre of
Sion was visible for several centuries but has been totally secret after the  century *end* It became
semi-visible during the s and s and became secret again in  *end* The group of monks that
made up the original order were led by Ursus of the Merovingians *end* They were given a place at Orval
in France until they apparently decided to move to the Holy Land *end* This order appears to have had the
power behind the scenes to have been in the position to select who would sit on the throne at
Jerusalem and the initially selected their man Godfroi de Bouillon *end* The Ordre de Sion Prieure de
Sion set up a military order called the Knights Templar *end* Louis VII of France became indepted to the
Knights Templar and in repayment of the help he had received he established some of the Ordre de
Sion at the priory of St *end* Samson along with establishing  men  groups of  at a small priory at
the Mount of Sion Orleans France *end* In  the Ordre de Sion let the Knights Templars apparently
go their own way which eventually was to trouble *end* The story of the Knights Templars is exceedingly
interesting because it relates to the Satanic International Bankers of today *end* The Knights Templars
became the first European wide International Bankers *end*
How their story fits into everything would take to long to tell at this point *end* At that time period when
the Knights Templars took off on their own the Ordre de Sion became the Prieure de Sion and also
used the names Ormus and Rose-Croix The Prieure de Sion is intimately connected to the creation
and guidance of the Rosicrucians and Freemasons *end* In the Be Wise As Serpents book chapter  it
talks about how the Prieure de Sion set up the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry *end*
In  the House of Lorraine part of the Prieure de Sion joined with the House of Stuart *end* After
that the Prieure de Sion began to display more interest in Scotland *end* Scotland was one of the few
countries wbere the Knights Tempiars had thrived when the order was suppressed by the order of the
Pope *end* Scotland also had several occult traditions operating *end* It was a hotbed of occult activity *end* Scotland and the Scottish people have played a very big role in the New World Order conspiracy for
centuries *end* Meanwhile when the Prieure de Sion went underground they established their archives in
some secret rooms beneath the chapel of St *end* Catherine at the castle at Gisors northern France in the
rue de Vienne *end* The archieves were according to reports contained in  coffers *end* Secret tunnels
connect the chapel with the local cemetery *end* The Merovingian descendents and the Prieure de Sion
have guarded the sacred blood line that Satan has built up *end* Their members are secretly scattered in
key positions throughout society *end* Many of the descendents are unaware of their heritage *end* For instance
within the Sinclair family only certain branches have kept up their generational occult heritage and
are aware of what is going on *end* Family trees subdivide over the centuries until the Merovingian family
tree has become a forest *end* The Houses of Hapsburg-Lorraine whose titles are dukes of Lorraine and
Kings of Jerusalem Plantard Luxembourg Montpezat Montesquiou among many others including
the Freeman family and hundreds of others *end* Be Wise As Serpents revealed for the first time as far as
I know how all the heads presidents of the LDS and RLDS have been descendents of the
Merovingian dynasty and they and the Masons have both used the Merovingian symbol the bee *end*
THE HOUSE OF DAVID

In my research of high level Satanists it became clear the the bloodline that was key in their minds
was the House of David--not Jesus Christ’s lineage *end* I discovered that the House of David had set up a
Kingdom in southern France *end* I discovered this while rummaging through history books on the Middle
Ages *end* I came upon a book A Jewish Princedom in Feudal France - *end* This book was the key for
me to realize that the Merovingian dynasty which wove its bloodline into the royal bloods of Europe
was Jewish in origin *end* When I read Holy Blood Holy Grail it became apparent that the authors theory
of Jesus’ bloodline had clouded their realization that the key was that the Prieure de Sion was of the
House of David and was in this sense Jewish although most of the Prieure de Sion are most likely
not attending synagogues *end* Indeed the Grand Master of the Prieure de Sion Pierre Plantard de Saint-
Clair told them so much *end* To quote the pertinent paragraph from The Messianic Legacy p *end*  "At
our meeting in April  M *end* Plantard adopted an ambivalent attitude towards our book Holy
Blood Holy Grail *end* On the whole be endorsed it and offered to correct for the French edition certain
vague or unclear references *end* At the same time he would neither confirm nor deny our thesis that the



Merovingian bloodline was descended from Jesus *end* There was no evidence either way he said non-
committally *end* It was ‘all too far in the past’ all ‘too long ago’ *end* There were no reliable genealogies *end* Besides Jesus had brothers *end* Nevertheless he acknowledged the Merovingians to have been of Judaic
descent deriving from the royal line of David." The significance of this tremendous *end* It means that
those people who have been saying that it is a Jewish conspiracy have been correct--even if some of
these people saying these things may not be greatest characters *end* This also opens the door as to why
the top leaders of the Illuminati have been willing to work with the Askenazi Jews *end* In Be Wise As
Serpents I show from Masonic sources that there is indeed a big connection at the top with the Jewish
leadership and the House of David and Freemasonry *end* The goals of Freemasonry are entertwined with
the goals of the Prieure de Sion *end* There is a big danger in labelling the conspiracy "Jewish" *end* When
people label "jewish" as "bad" it confuses more than clarifies *end* The Jewish people are not the enemy *end* Next although many of the Satanic hierarchy claim to be from the House of David they do not
publicly proclaim themselves as Jews in fact they may publicly take a negative posture toward the
Jews such as Lady Astor and some of the duPonts have been *end*
It is perhaps fine that Zionism be labelled evil *end* Zionism includes both Christians and Jews *end* To be a
zionist is to identify oneself with a movement that the elite has set up and controlled for their
purposes *end* Many in the Zionist movement are like common people everywhere they want do to what
is right they have simply not gotten the bigger picture and are being used *end* When two groups have
some similarities but each want to keep their own identity they can be mortal rivals *end* One group that
has been very easy for Satan to provoke against Christians is the Jews *end* Perhaps no group of people
has hated Christians with more intensity *end* One of the first groups that Satan worked at controlling were
the Jews *end* But to call the conspiracy Jewish is misleading *end* The father of it all is Satan *end* It is Satanic
and it will use anyone it can *end* And God will use anyone too *end* How many of us have escaped helping
one cause or another of the establishment or in being in some organization that the establishment was
using *end* Let each of us examine ourselves and get our own lives in order *end* There is a song about violin
that was going to auctioned off cheap until a master violinist picked it up and played a good tune on
it *end* Don’t auction people off cheaply the touch of the Master’s hand can turn anyone into a beautiful
thing *end* Don’t reject anyone who will let the Master’s hand tune his life *end* This is a war against evil not
race *end* Not everyone of the most evil bloodlines is on the enemies’ side *end* Many are trying to serve the
Lord *end* Likewise just because the Freeman family is one of the top  Satanic families doesn’t mean
that all or even most Freemans are part of the hierarchy *end*
GAYLORD FREEMAN AS GRAND MASTER

From  to  Jean Cocteau was Grand Master of the Prieure de Sion *end* Following the unification
of the various powers into a secret NWO government in  the Prieure de Sion had a major policy
dispute *end* in  with Cocteau’s death Gaylord Freeman helped by Antonio Merzagora and Pierre
Plantard de Saint-Clair governed the Prieure de Sion *end* In  Pierre Plantard took over as Grand
Master *end* In  long before becoming Grand Master Plantard de Saint-Clair transferred  million
francs worth of gold igots to Switzerland to the Union des Banques Suisses *end* When this was publicly
revealed he said that it was a legitimate move made for the french government *end* In  several men
associated with the Prieure de Sion obtained some old parchments two of which gave the
Merovingian genealogies and they used the british Notary of Royal Appointment Patrick Francis
Jourdan Freeman that’s one name in relation to a request to the French government to take the old
documents to London England where they were kept at  Great Russell St *end* Later P.F.J *end* Freeman
was used again the next year to request that the documents be allowed to stay in Engiand to be held in
a safe deposit box at Lloyd’s Bank of Europe in London *end* One of the men involved went by the name
Captain Ronald Stansmore Nutting of London born in Dublin IR who is reported by reliable
sources to have been in British Intelligence MI and had sat on the board of directors of at least
companies including Arthur Guinness and Guardian Assurance *end* He was chairman of the board of the
British and Irish Steam Packet Company *end* He was also governor of the Bank of Ireland *end* One of
Guardian Assurance’s departmental chairmen was also an MIS operative besides Capt *end* Nutting *end* Another P.d.S *end* member who was with Nutting was Viscount Frederick Leathers who was british



Minister of War Transport during W.W *end* II *end* Viscount Leathers had a business associate and longtime
friend Sir William

Stephenson who was the wartime chief for MI’s american branch office called BSC British
Security Coordination in New York *end* Another friend of Leathers was Connop Guthrie also headed
BSC for MI- in New York *end* Guthrie was a shipping executive *end* Due to internal trouble in the Prieure
de SIon that resulted from a rule that members had to place a birth certificate and signiture with the
Priory an Engiish faction created forgeries of birth certificates and signitures and in secret protest
sent these as originals to France *end* PJ *end* Freeman then got involved in this act of defiance *end* Another
division occured between the French members and the Brit.-American members *end* The french wanted
more of a role and some type of restoration of the monarchy in a United Europe *end* The Amer.-British
members who far outnumbered the few french wanted to skip the monarchy idea *end* The Vatican and the
Prieure de Sion P.d.S *end* - my personal abreviation work together *end* Apparently the Vatican is given
some type of minor kickback for their cooperation *end* John Drick A *end* Robert Abboud and Gaylord
Freeman were three members of the Prieure de Sion that were associated with the First National Bank
of Chicago *end* John Drick had started as an assistent cashier in  and became a vice-president three
years later *end* In  Drick became both the president and one of the directors of the bank *end* He also was
on the board of a number of other companies including Stephan Chemical MCA incorporated Oak
Industries and Central Illinois Public Service *end* The Guardian Royal Exchange Assurance the
Guardian Assurance in London where P.J *end* Freeman worked had shared a building with the First
National Bank of Chicago which had Gaylord Freeman as chairman of the board of directors *end* In other
words the two businesses and the two Freemans all connected its seems to the Prieure de Sion and
then by other inferences all connected back to the hierarchy *end* Gaylord Freeman’s signiture appeared
on a Prieure de Sion document of Dec *end*   *end* Gaylord Freeman never publicly admitted that he
even knew anything about the P.d.S *end*
GRAND MASTER GAYLORD FREEMAN and
ROGER FREEMAN instructed the U.S *end* government

On the next page is a photocopy of the article that the New York Times ran when Gaylord Gale
Freeman died *end* It has often been said if you want to know who really runs things look at a man’s
advisors *end* Now check this out Gaylord Freeman never ran for any major political office--and the
voting process is supposedly to get men who know what they are doing into omce and yet if you read
the N.Y *end* Times biography you will read "Mr *end* Freeman...was frequently called on by Washington for
advice and assistance.’ Yes Presidents and Congressman called Gaylord Freeman for advice
instructions might be a better term and yet most of us haven’t even heard of the man *end* Again for
those who think that only the Rockefellers and Rothschilds are powerful families let me ask why
weren’t they calling Rockefeller *end* Not only did the Presidents turn to Gaylord Freeman for advice
orders they also turned to anotber member of the family Roger A *end* Freeman *end* Roger A *end* Freeman was
a senior fellow at the Hoover Institute *end* I suspect Roger was Jewish but the newspaper doesn’t say
any religion *end* The New York Times biographical news article that came out when Roger died is also
put on the next page *end* Note that in the headline they emphasize that Roger Freeman played the role as
advisor to  presidents *end* And yet I doubt that hardly any American has heard of him *end* One prominent
Freeman James D *end* Freeman has played a leadership role in Unity School *end* James Freeman has written
at least six important books for Unity which they have published *end* Two of his works are Unity School
and The Story of Unity *end* Had the article on spiritual warfare covered ritual sites in Kansas-Missouri I
would have mentioned about the Unity School *end* Near ajoining the Unity School in between Kansas
City Ks *end* and Kansas City Mo *end* is a strip of wooded land *end* Little Ricky Rd *end* goes through this area and
the forest along Little Ricky Rd *end* has been used for Satanic rituals by a coven that was made up of
adults not teenagers-Interestingly a man who was part of the Unity School hierarchy and came to
Christ told me that the school secretly conducted Luciferian initiations and that Robert Schuler °
Mason and leading Protestant clergyman knew all about Luciferian initiations being conducted there
yet Schuler went ahead and taught his principles of church growth to Unity School *end* They call the
school Unity School of Christianity but a more accurate name would be Unity School of Witchcraft *end* Many witches have in fact been associated with the Unity Church and are closely working with it to



secretly destroy Christianity *end* I know from inside information that the hierarchy is sending orders to
the school so it would not surprise me if James D *end* Freeman was actually part of the Freeman family
that is one of the top  Illuminati families *end* Some of the family are clearly jewish such as Ernest
Robert Freeman who lives in Maryland and is an important jewish leader *end* He has been the dlr *end* of the
Jewish Community Council in his area and President of the Sachs/Freeman Assoc *end* The Sachs family
also ties into the conspiracy so that is interesting *end* And Grace Freeman who is jewish wrote Inside
the Synagogue *end* Some of the Freemans are leaders in Christendom too *end* Lee Jackson Freeman is an
American Baptist minister *end* He went to Union Theological Seminary which is a totally ungodly place-
-they turn out socialists for graduates etc *end* Lee Jackson Freeman was a member of the executive board
of the national ministries of the American Baptist Church *end* He also served in the Ecumenical
Ministries in his Scranton PA area *end* R *end* Lexie Freeman is a Nashville Tenn *end* Methodist pastor
Waverly Place who is a Freemason *end*
ORIGINS OF THE FAMILY

There are obviously different unrelated family lines that have the last name Freeman *end* In the
preliminary genealogical work that I have done I have found Freemans coming from England France
Germany and Austria *end* Howard L *end* Freeman is a Christian author who has written about how the
economic system of our nation is ungodly *end* I wrote him a letter of inquiry about the Freeman family *end* He wrote me and told me that his family came from the English town of Barnstaple *end* And that the
Freemans in that area treated him as a royal guest when he visited the area *end* He was shown around
England over a  mile radius by the Freemans in England *end* His opinion was that his last name did not
originate in Barnstaple England *end* The history books record an M.P *end* Member of Parliament back in
the times when our revolution was being plotted who was named Sambrooke Freeman c *end* - *end* He was from Fawley Court near Henley in Berkshire *end* He went to Oxford *end* I do not know if the
Freemans in Moriah the Illuminati are from England originally but from the little clues I have that
would be my first guess *end* If not England then likely France *end* Mary Freeman of Marlborough
Wiltshire England claimed back in  that on // almost at midnight that she Mary
Freeman was leaving the ancIent Druid stone circle at Avebury when she saw a UFO over Silbury
Hill *end* Most people are interested In her UFO report--l’m curious why this Freeman lady was out late at
night at some ancient Druid site *end*
ILLUMINATI & SATANISM

Due to time restraints I haven’t progressed as far in my research as I would like *end* However I have
been able to identify one Freeman in the Illuminati *end* He was Minnesota’s Gov *end* Orville Freeman who
appointed Walter Mondale to the position of Attorney General when Walter was just  years old *end* Walter Mondale later enjoyed the status of being the only U.S *end* Senator on the Trilateral Commission *end* Walter Mondale went on to serye the Illuminati as U.S *end* Vice-president and Orville Freeman was
appointed as a cabinet member for Kennedy’s and then Johnson’s administration *end* Another Freeman is
listed on secret membership lists as joining the Order of Skull & Bones in  *end* See his picture which
is reproduced *end* Don Freeman wrote books on witches including Space Witch and Tilly Witch *end* Another Freeman was instrumental in the O.T.O *end* being set up *end* For those who know about the O.T.O *end* I’ve mentioned it in the past it is hermetic magic and Satanism *end* Right here in Oregon we have been
watching some Freemans because it appears that there are some Satanic coven members here in
Oregon who are Freemans *end*
FREEMAN FAMILY WRITES BOOKS

It is interesting to look at some of the titles that various Freemans have authored *end* Here is a sampling--
see if some of these don’t sound like the authors could be potential candidates for being in a coven *end*
Martin Freeman--Forecasting Astrology plus several other astrology books

Richard B *end* Freeman--The Overeducated American



Michael Freeman--Cohabitation Without Marriage

Lucy Freeman--Listening to the Inner Self

Kathleen Freeman--books on the Greeks’ philosophy

A.V *end* Freeman--International Responsibility of States for Denial of Justice

Harold Freeman--Toward Socialism In America

Jo Freeman- books promoting Women’s Liberation" such as Politics of Women’s Liberation and
Women a Feminist Perspective

David F *end* Freeman wrote a Handbook on Private Foundations *end* That’s interesting because if anyone is
skilled in creating foundations especially private ones Its the Illuminati *end*
The Freeman family includes many lawyers doctors and psychiatrists *end* Some of the Freeman
scientists are studying areas that are interesting *end* A.J *end* Freeman wrote on his area of expertise
Magnetoelectric Interaction Phenomena in Crystals *end* Sounds like a subject people interacting with the
UFOs might study *end*
TIES TO OTHER IMPORTANT FAMILIES

Part of what I can do for the reader is to begin to give hIm or her a feel for how the Freeman family
connects into the rest of things *end* This next section’s information will include information that only
tangently relates to the Freemans but is important to place them in the context of what is happening
back stage out of the sight of the world’s eyes *end* The Freemans in the Satanic hierarchy in the U.S *end* work with the Illuminati families of the Collins and Wheeler families *end* Readers are already familiar
with the Collins family but not the Wheelers *end* Now let me explain who the Wheelers are because I
am trying to put some pieces of the puzzle in place for you *end* Gen *end* Earl Wheeler and his brother Leo
Wheeler a Grande Master of the Illuminati see the top diagram pg *end*  // newsletter are secret
Satanists and also ° Freemasons *end* Leo Wheeler by virtue of his Grande Master status in the satanic
hierarchy has been able to visit the Dulce N.M *end* underground facility *end* The route he used was to fly in
and then the last stretch is done in a black limousine *end* Various people in the Dulce area have
occasionally spotted these VIP black limousines *end* The Wheeler family has a long history of
involvement with Satanism and its genealogical history goes back to the House of David *end* An
amazing clue or an amazing coincidence appears when we look at the genealogy of the Mormon
leaders *end* The Be Wise As Serpents book makes the connections of the Mormon leadership but it
doesn’t appear that many have read or understood the significance *end* Maybe this here will help *end* The
top Mormon leadership LDS & RLDS all are related and descendants of the Merovingians but for
sake of discussion let us take Brigham Young *end* Brigham Young’s first name was Brigham *end* It was
given to him because of the importance of the Brigham family *end* His grandmother was Sibil Brigham *end* Sibyls were prophetesses of the ancient world and the name is a semi-common occult name *end* Brigham
Young and his family practiced magic *end* They were also intimately aware of their genealogy which
goes back to the Merovingian Dynasty *end* One wonders if it is coincidence that the Merovingians’
primary symbol--the bee is also the symbol for the Mormon church and Utah *end* Look at a Deseret
Industries Mormon thrift stores building in your area and you will see the bee on their side *end* But not
only does Brigham Young have Merovingian blood from at least two lines of blood and possibly as
many as  lines of blood back but he also is related to the Collins family of Massachusetts that we
wrote about in the // newsletter *end* Further Brigham Young is also a blood relative of the Wheelers *end* This is the clue which is amazing *end* A *end* chart of all this is given on the next page *end* If Young’s Wheeler
relatives are related to the Satanic Illuminati Wheelers then we have an example of how  strains of
top Satanic blood have interwoven and resulted in the birth of the Freemason Witch and President of
the LDS Brigham Young *end* Perhaps the tie-in doesn’t exist but it certainly is worthy of our
examination *end*
DIGRESSING ABOUT THE MORMON CONNECTION



There may be some disinformation put out on this by the other side after this comes out--so don’t be
taken in by their establishment *end* As I have mentioned before a descendent of Joseph Smith Jr *end* who
was Satanic Ritually Abuse victim has quietly told certain people that her family is indeed a Satanic
bloodline *end* Further I have mentioned other confidential pieces of information about how the leaders of
the Salt Lake City Mormon church LDS are working with the various parts of the Illuminati’s
empire incl *end* the Jehovah’s Witnesses *end* Although the public split occurred between Mormonism and
Masonry before the Mormons went to Utah that was only for public consumption *end* The leadership
have coordinated activities *end* The Mormon religion is really a high rite of Freemasonry and this
explains why when the Mormons went to Utah the Mormons held Masonic schools *end* Hosea Stout
mentions these Mormon Masonic schools in On The Mormon Frontier; The Diary of Hosea Stout ed *end* by Juanita Brooks  vols *end* Salt Lake City Univ *end* of Utah Press     *end* After going to
Utah Brigham Young contacted the chiefs of Freemasonry in England and proposed that Mormonism
be granted a public charter to become its own Masonic Rite *end* The hierarchy told him no *end* After that
Brigham Young began to publicly distance Mormonism from Masonry and the Masons strangely
broke many of their own rules to distance themselves publicly from Mormonism *end*
LDS apostle Reed Smoot was given permission to run for office by the LDS church *end* Pres *end* Harding
appointed him to the World War Foreign Debt Commission and he also seryed the elite as the
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee *end* The War Finance Corp *end* just happened due to Smoots
arranging it to gave the LDS church a  million loan *end* Marriner S *end* Eccles of an old elite family and
a Mormon and an Illuminatus became Sec *end* of the Treasury in  and was chairman of the

SUMMARY

We find the Freeman family popping up asbe Grand Master of the Prieure de Sion as a co-rounder
of the O.T.O *end* as a member of the Skull and Bones as a powerful ADL member as members of
Satanic covens and as authors *end* of occult books as well as other suspicious things *end* It also should be
mentioned that two of the Freemans have been very important advisors to the U.S *end* Presidents and
many other high political leaders *end* The Freeman family has all the earmarks of being one of the top
Illuminati families as my confidential sources reveal *end*
MORE ON THE FREEMANS

In  *end* Pulitzer prize winner James B *end* Stewart the front page editor of the Wall Street Journal came
out with his book Den of Thieves *end* The book is the detailed story of how major insiders on Wall Street
were systematic crooks *end* The four biggest names of the insider-trading ring were Michael Milken
Ivan Boesky Martin Siegel and Dennis Levine *end* Robert Freeman worked with the ring and ended up
pleading guilty after the evidence cornered him *end* I am always suspicious of exposes of the
establIshment done by the establishment’s system *end* Often the big crooks get away and the middie
management take the blame *end* Take for instance Iran-Contra *end* But Stewart’s book Den of Thieves may
be helpful in our unstanding the Freeman family better *end* The Freeman family is one of the top
Illuminati families *end*


At this time there is nothing to tie Robert Freeman to Satanism and that is not the purpose here *end* In an
investigation all the possible clues are collected *end* I am bringing my readership into this investigation
of the top  families and here is a possible suspect to make note of *end* Robert Freeman worked for the
Jewish investment firm of Goldman Sachs *end* Goldman Sach’s headquarters *end* in on Broad St *end* In NY
NY *end* Just a short distance from Goldman Sach’s trading floor in their headquarters building on the
glass-enclosed  floor was Robert Freeman’s office *end* Robert Freeman was a graduate of
Dartmouth *end* He liked to vacation in Colorado skiing with his family *end* He worked with Siegel and
Boesky especially in his illegal insider deals *end* These insiders made millions off investors and would
have made billions if they hadn’t been arrested *end* Freeman and Siegel made some complicated deals
such as the Unocal and the Storer affairs *end* Boesky went to Russia after prison and offered his financial
talents but was politely rebuffed *end* One of the men involved with the ring was Milken *end* Milken’s
influence had been a major factor behind the stock market recovery after Black Monday  *end* That
was Monday Oct *end*  and the stock market plunged over  pts *end* that day *end* Milken convinced
investors to invest in the stock market and the Federal Reserve flooded the market with cash too to
prevent a disaster *end* MIlken was & maybe still is a close friend of Mason Jessie Jackson *end* Milken is
heralded by many prominent Jews even after his arrest as a great Jew *end* That’s not my opinion a
newspaper article will back that up *end* The Drexel firm associated with Milken was advised by the
Federal Reserve the SEC the Treasury and the Stock Exchange to declare bankruptcy with Chapter
 which they did *end* Goldman and Sachs both Jews went to bat for Freeman and hired private
detectives to help his case *end* Kaye Scholar in NY represented Freeman legally *end* Eventually Robert
Freeman pleaded guilty and was given a four-month sentence which he served and was released on
Aug *end*   *end* The significant part is that Robert Freeman was someone who was one of the major
players in the New York Stock Exchange *end* Robert Freeman is not to be confused with Ernest Robert
Freeman who also is connected to the Sachs family and was mentioned In the original article on the
Freeman family Mar *end*   *end*


Bloodlines of Illuminati

By

Fritz Springmeier

THE KENNEDY FAMILY

To be a researcher and to be informed that the Kennedy family is a top  llluminati family is akin to
being told a needle is in a haystack *end* Someone has estimated that there are  Kennedys in the
United States *end* And on a list of the most populous surnames of Ireland in  Kennedy ranked  *end* And a recent book listed it as  most common today *end* Fortunately there is information that allows
me to identify at least part of the Satanic Kennedies from all the rest of the Kennedys *end* You will learn
some of this later in the article *end*
KENNEDY TIES TO OTHER ELITE FAMILIES

Again the ties between various Illuminati families is very involved and a long unraveling process
similar to untieing a set of bad knots confronts the researcher *end* The Kennedy family abounds with
marriages to names such as Anketells Baileys Booths Buckleys Collins Hatfields Humphreys
Freemans James Phelps Reagans Russells and Smiths *end* The Kennedys that we will look closest at
are related to the Fitzpatricks a powerful Irish family whose coat of arms has  fleur-de-lis with a
dragon and a lion *end* The Fitzpatricks may tie back to France and they may possibly part of the Sang
Royal Sangraal--Sang Raal is the term used in the older manuscripts which can mean both Royal
bloodline or Holy Grail *end* Jackie Bouvier Kennedy Onassis who married John F *end* Kennedy was tied to
the Auchinclosses via her sister’s marriage into the Auchincloss family *end* The Auchinclosses are
Scottish bloodline of the Illuminati *end* "One can fairly hear the woof and tweet of history whistle through
the names of the ramified Auchincloss tribe Bunt Grosvenor Rockefeller Saltonstall Tiffany
Vanderbilt and Winthrop among others." For instance Hugh D *end* Auchincloss Sr *end* married Emma
Brewster Jennings daughter of Oliver B *end* Jennings who co-founded Standard Oil with John D *end* Rockefeller *end* As for the numerous Kennedy intermarriages with notable names for instance Bernet
Shafer Kennedy - married Phebe Freeman in  *end* But then the question arises--were
either of these people secretly part of the occult *end* Andrew Kennedy married Margaret Penny Hatfield
- *end* The Andrew Kennedy family is allied with the Hatfield Bailey Collins and Mullins
families *end* Again a person is confronted with a great deal of clues but precious little time and resources
to try following up the numerous leads *end*
ORIGINS OF THE FAMILY & THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE KENNEDY’S  See footnote
for the reference to consult concerning this entire section *end*
There are several versions of how the Kennedys got started but when one goes in and examines
things what turns out is that the origins of the Kennedys is Ireland are very clear *end* They are
descendants of Brian Born also known as Brian Caeneddi and his nephew who spelled it Cinneide *end* The name thereafter was O’Kennedy *end* They originally were a Dalcassion sept and were in the area
near Killahoe and Killokennedy parish is a reminder of that ancient fact *end* The O’Briens and
MacNamaras forced them into new territories where they became the Lords of Ormond--what is now
north Tipperary *end* Most Kennedys in Ireland today are still found in that area *end* The Kennedys remained
powerful into the  century *end*
The Kennedy family divided up into  branches

THE SCOTTISH KENNEDYS

Around  a Scottish branch of the Kennedys appeared *end* There are several stories as to how they got
their name Kennedy and it is possible that they were not from Ireland *end* However interestingly
genealogists have ascertained that whether the various branches of the aristocratic Kennedys in
Scotland and Ireland may have different origins because the origins of the Scottish branch is unclear-
-it can be shown that they all subsequently intermarried and became related if they were not related to
begin with *end* Gayle Marie Kennedy points this out on page  of her book My Kennedy Ancestors.. *end* ‘It
is believed that all the foregoing Kennedy families are related either by virtue of being descendants of
common ancestors or by intermarriage." I looked up in Burke’s General Armory to get a listing of the
aristocratic Kennedys and here is what I got

Kennedys of Ardmillan County Ayr Scotland

Kennedys of Auchtyfardell County Lanark

Kennedys of Blairquhan County Ayr Scotland

Kennedys of Clowburn *end* County Ayr Scotland

Kennedys of Cultura County Down Northern Ireland

Kennedys of Dublin Fun Ent  Ulster Ireland

Kennedys of Girvanmains County Ayr Scotland

Kennedys of Hill Foot Ireland

Kennedys of Kirkmiehael County Ayr Scotland

Kennedys of Kirmucks Aberdeen Scotland

Kennedys of Londonberry Northern Ireland

Kennedys of Tombrechan County Tipperary Ireland

Kennedys of Underwood County Ayr  Scotland

Kennedys of Visit Dublin  Ireland

Johnstown-Kennedy of County Dublin Ireland

Kennedys of Bargany and Ardstencher County Ayr Scotland

Kennedys of Kirkhill from the Bargany group  Scotland

It is clear that there have been quite a number of powerful aristocratic Kennedys *end* One of the more
powerful recent Scottish aristocrat Kennedys was the Marquess of Ailsa - *end* Because he is
often called the Marquess of Ailsa you might not know him by his name Archibald Kennedy who was
the  Earl of Cassillis *end* This branch of the Kennedys married into Scottish royalty *end* For instance Sir
James Kennedy married Mary a daughter of King Robert III and their son was Sir Gilbert Kennedy
was made Lord Kennedy before  *end* Archibald Kennedy was an extremely powerful Freemason and
held numerous key positions in the Grand Lodge of Scotland *end* He was st Grand Principle from



to his death in  *end* At his death his titles passed to his brother Charles *end* Archibald Kennedy was
initiated in Holyrood House Lodge No *end*  Edinburgh Nov *end*   *end*  Famous Freemasons
Vol *end* l--put out by the Missouri Lodge of Research p *end*

HOW ARE THE VARIOUS PROMINENT KENNEDYS RELATED *end*
So the question always arises as I examine the elite of the Illuminati and the New World Order--how is
this Kennedy related to this other Kennedy *end* For instance how is David M *end* Kennedy who is a
Bilderberger and William Jesse Kennedy III who is a key man for the Duke Illuminati family--he is
pres *end* of Mutual life Insur *end* Co a Duke financial asset  of RCA trustee of the Ford Theater where
the elite killed lincoln and associated with the Pilgrim Soc *end* through the Conference Board of NYC? *end* Although I can’t explain the exact ties I can safely say that if one goes back several hundred years the
Kennedy aristocrats all tie together *end*
BEGINNING AT THE BEGINNING

One of my first clues that the Kennedys had something to do with the Illuminati was the conspiracy
book The Widow’s Son-- The Historical Illuminatus Chronicles Vol *end*  by Robert Anton Wilson *end* Robert Anton Wilson and Robert Shea authors of "Illuminatus!" are not Christians *end* On the contrary
they are regular participants in the central Ohio Starwood Festival for witches and pagans *end* Robert
Anton Wilson has publicly on a number of occasions explained that he is a gnostic and a great fan of
Aleister Crowley *end* I picked up Wilson’s book The Widow’s Son in a Satanic/New Age bookstore *end* In
both volume  the teaser chapter at the end and in volume  of The Historical Illuminatus Chronicles
one is taught the significance of Brian Caeneddi the first Kennedy and how Brian Caeneddi’s blood
got into some very important royal bloodlines *end* It is interesting that an informed man like Wilson who
spends time doing rituals with Gnostics and Witches would declare that the Kennedy family is an
important bloodline in connection with the Illuminati *end* How many people knew that Tip O’Neil
speaker of the house of representatives was a descendent of the Kennedy clan *end* Wilson writes for New
Agers and witches not for Christians *end* One gets the feel that his experience with the occult has
somehow given him a very good idea of what is going on in terms of the Masons the Illuminati etc *end* He writes his books in such a way that they are historical novels with a great deal of facts and yet one
is always left wondering by the style of writing whether the author wants to be taken serious or not is
what he writes make-believe or history padded with some fiction *end* I personally believe it is just the
way the occult works they expose the facts for their own people but in a way that will not be taken
seriously by others *end* Wilson acts like a buffoon one minute and a serious conspiracy researcher the
next and he will act both ways all in one article or even on a single page of his books *end* When a person
checks up on Wilson’s facts they usually hold true *end* On my part the information about Brian Caennedi
was astounding *end* I had to go as soon as possible to verify it from other sources and it turns out Wilson
was accurate about their genealogy and their importance in the Illuminati activities historically etc *end*
THE ILLUMINATI & MATTHEW KENNEDY

One of the chief lodges for the branch Illuminati prior to  was located in a hugh chateau at
Ermenonville near Paris France *end* The land belonged to the Marquis of Gerardin who protected
Rosseau and later gave Rosseau a tomb on his estate *end* St *end* Germain precided over this Illuminated
lodge *end* This Illuminated lodge carried out blood rituals with a altar made from human bones *end* Interestingly one of St *end* Germain’s good friends who came over from Ireland to Paris was Matthew
Kennedy - *end* Matthew Kennedy was connected with St *end* Germain’s court and wrote A
Chronological *end* Genealogical and Historical Dissertation of the Royal Family of the Stuarts *end* In
the Stuart family had married into the Sang raal and began to play a role in the genealogies of the
Prieure de Sion *end* Frederick of the Palatinate after he married Elizabeth Stuart established an occult
‘Rosicrucian’ state *end* It was Frederick who helped start the bloody  yrs *end* war between the Protestants
and Catholics *end* The Stuarts spread the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry throughout Europe *end* For a while the
Prieure de Sion seems to have backed the Stuarts but at some point quit *end* St *end* Germain is revered as a
Christ figure by the I AM movement and the Church Universal Triumphant and other new age groups *end* A picture that looks similar to Christ but which is actually a picture of St *end* Germain hangs in many of



the houses of people involved with the I AM movement or its spin-offs *end* It is significant that an Irish
Kennedy who was interested and liked the Stuart dynasty would be part of St *end* Germain’s court and a
popular writer for them *end*
JOHN FITZGERALD KENNEDY

If John F *end* Kennedy had not been assassinated and so much about his life examined and written about
a window allowing us to see the Kennedy Illuminati family may never have opened so wide *end* First the
assassination attracted attention *end* In recent years the Illuminati have given permission to publishing
houses to print exposes of J.F.K.’s sexual life etc *end* It is believed that this permission was given in an
effort to deflect criticism of his assassination by allowing his reputation to be tarnished *end* I hope my
readers are beginning to realize that things are totally corrupt at the top and that JFK was no different
than so many others that have been and are today at the top of the political mess in this nation *end* John
F *end* Kennedy had a very active sex life even after he married Jackie and even after he was President in
the White House *end* For those who don’t think secrets can be kept by the elite one only has to look at
how John F *end* Kennedy was able to have sex with many women while President and to have frequent
nude swim parties at the White House pool and the general public not know anything about it *end* John
F *end* Kennedy’s lust for women was well known by the elite *end* Illuminatus McGeorge Bundy warned his
friend JFK while JFK was a Senator that John’s openness with women might get him into trouble
with the public *end* John F *end* Kennedy was so open about his sexual habit that at one party at the
Mayflower Hotel in Washington D.C *end* John F *end* Kennedy openly had sex with one pardner in front of
the party while his friend Senator Estes Kefauver did the same *end* Then they swapped pardners and
began again in plain view *end* John F *end* Kennedy had many "one-night-stands" as the world calls them *end* These were merely women hustled up by his aides or the secret service or his friends like Frank
Sinatra *end* But Kennedy also had long term relationships with some of the women he was sexually active
with *end* It is those relationships which reveal so much about the hidden Satanic side of the KennedYs *end* John F *end* Kennedy had three long term girlfriends Marilyn Monroe Jane Mansfield and Zsa Zsa Gabor
which were ALSO girlfriends of Anton LaVey who has headed the Church of Satan *end* Jayne Mansfield
was a high priestess of the Church of Satan *end* Marilyn Monroe was a participant in LaVey’s satanic
rituals before LaVey founded his Church of Satan *end* Both JFK and his brother Robert Kennedy had
affairs going with Marilyn Monroe and both visited her just prior to her mysterious death *end* Zsa Zsa has
been interested for years in the occult *end* JFK also had relationships with other women connected with
the Illuminati also *end* Before we examine the significance of these three relationships of JFK’s and
before we get into his liaisons with other women who were Illuminati connected let’s cover the
relationship between Anton LaVey and the Illuminati *end* California was very fertile soil for Satanism due
to a host of factors *end* Two lesser known factors are that there were Haitian communities which practiced
voodoo in California at the early part of this century *end* Also California became a haven for witches and
Satanists fleeing from France So *end* America Cuba and other places where their Satanic practices were
not tolerated *end* California had a reputation for acceptance of their evil rituals *end* When one adds to this
such things as Hollywood it is easy to see how San Bernandino valley has become such a strong
Satanic center *end* Anton LaVey’s maternal grandmother was from Transylvannia *end* It was from that side of
the family the Anton got some encouragement toward the occult *end* Anton La Vey loved horror movies *end* He studied Aleister Crowley and the O.T.O *end* which had lodges in California which is where he lived
and in  he joined the Clyde Beatty Circus *end* The Beatty family connects in with the Illuminati
families also by the way *end* LaVey worked for several circuses and learned how to be a showman *end* He
worked the occult sideshows of the circus and found that people wanted to believe occult frauds *end* Anton LaVey found Marilyn Monroe a jewish girl working as a striptease in the strip clubs *end* LaVey
helped her performance and through his connections got her started on her big career *end* LaVey used his
talent of showmanship to create a type of Satanism that could be marketed to the public *end* LaVey
always manages to walk a tight-rope between openly supporting hard-core Satanic practices such as
human sacrifice and being just simply theatrics *end* In other words he blatantly supports enough evil to
attract evil people but he publicly never allows himself to be connected in any way with child
molestation human sacrifice etc *end* Anton LaVey was into Satanism before the ’s but it was not
until  that he founded the Church of Satan *end* Some hard core Satanists feel he is "all show" other
hard core Satanists form covens and try to serve Anton LaVey because they view him as a role model *end*


The Illuminati set up their headquarters in Southern California this century *end* San Bernadino county is
their headquarters *end* Of course as I have written before that the Illuminati is too secret to carry out any
thing themselves *end* They need co-workers *end* The Illuminati is strictly hereditary *end* The Illuminati secretly
control the Satanic cults at what is sometimes described as Stage  and Stage  of Satanism *end* The lower
levels are for recruits the grunts the privates so to speak in Satan’s army *end* In the San Bernadino area
one type of high priest of Stage  or  is the Master Counselor *end* Other positions include the Keeper of
the Books and the Keeper of the Seal *end* In the late ’s Mike Warnke who was a high priest a Master
Counselor raised the number of Satanists in the first  stages to  members in the San Bernadino
area San Bernandino-Riverside-Colton *end* Bear in mind that these  active Satanists are not
Illuminati members--they are much lower than the lower Illuminati ranks such as the Sisters of Light *end* The Sisters of Light and Five-Star generals and an Asmodeus who are the middle management types
of the World Order who direct the upper levels of priests of the covens of Satanism that are open to the
public *end* Anton LaVey participates in conferences for the occult where Satanism the first  stages and
secret Illuminati overseers are present *end* In other words LaVey is not out of touch with hard core
Satanism he just manages to keep his public profile clean *end* It is meant that way *end* Anton LaVey is a
publicity agent to give Satanism a good image *end*
MARILYN MONROE

Anton LaVey knew how to be a showman *end* He took Marilyn Monroe helped her with her acting and
with his connections helped her get a chance to act *end* John F *end* Kennedy had a long term relationship with
Marilyn Monroe *end* When J.F.K *end* was elected at the convention to be the Presidential candidate the
Kennedys threw a party at the convention *end* The party was described this way "every delegate at the
conventioni was provided by the Kennedy group with anything they wanted for their entertainment
including liquor and women sent to their room." JFK spent the time at the convention and the next day
afterwards "making love’ to Marilyn Monroe *end* After his acceptance speech the whole group went over
to his close friend Peter Lawfords for a skinnydipping party *end* Peter Lawford Frank Sinatra and
Sammmy Davis Jr *end* were close friends to each other and to John F *end* Kennedy *end* Sammy Davis Jr *end* became a member of the Church of Satan after LaVey started it *end* From the middle of  to the end of
 JFK had a suite on the  floor of Washington’s Mayflower Hotel set aside for his extramarital
affairs *end* FBI File

JAYNE MANSFIELD

During the ’s Jayne Mansfield and John F *end* Kennedy had their relationship *end* They met at places
like Beverly Hills Malibu Palm Springs *end* JFK had several men who "bearded" for him *end* That is they
would act like the women JFK was to get were their own date *end* One of these was Dave Powers who
even went so far as to write in a book Johnny We Hardly Knew Ye that whenever Jackie left
Washington *end* JFK Jack and him would eat together and then the President would say his prayers and
go to bed alone *end* One of the things Dave Powers did was to help procure a steady stream of new
women for Jack *end*
Some of the other on-going sexual relationship that JFK maintained were

- Lady Jean Campbell-daughter of the Duke of Argyll

??Flo Pritchett Smith-wife of the American Ambassador to Cuba

- Kay-Kay Hannon Auchincloss - In this case although they had a long term close relationship no-
ones knows what they did together *end*
- Judith Campbell Exner- Judith was Sinatra’s girlfriend who he passed on as a favor *end* Judith worked
for the Mafia in particular she worked for Sam Giancana and John Roselli who for some reason also
both worked for the CIA *end*
Exner ran letters between the Mafia and John F *end* Kennedy while he was President *end* according to
People Magazine "The Dark Side of Camelot" Feb *end*   *end*


It is also known that JFK was in direct contact with Meyer Lansky and Joe Fishetti two other Mafia
chiefs and that he benefit from money they passed on to him *end* This is no surprise because Jack’s father
had worked with the Mafia Jack’s entire life *end* There are a number of respectable books by ex-Satanists
or ex-Organized Crime members where they are clear about how those groups love to blackmail
people *end* John F *end* Kennedy certainly could have been easily blackmailed by these groups if they had
wanted to *end* I haven’t seen any indication that blackmail was even tried so the only other conclusion
which fits a lot of evidence is that John F *end* Kennedy worked with the Satanists and the Mafia *end* In fact
the Mafia rigged several important counties in the election like in Chicago which tipped the scales in
John winning the Presidency *end* That’s an entirely different thing that this article won’t get sidetracked
on *end*
A POEM BY JACKIE

Something that Jackie wrote on their honeymoon about Jack seems to me significant *end* When Jack and
Jackie we newlyweds after their wedding Sept *end*  the President of Mexico Don Miguel Alemán let
Jackie and Jack use his villa *end* During their use of the Mexican President’s villa Jackie wrote a poem
about John her new husband *end*
"He would find love

He would never find peace

For he must go seeking

The Golden Fleece."

A Woman Named Jackie p *end*  *end*
One of the writing projects that I have wanted to see done and I have delegated it to a good friend is
to give my readers an article on MJ- a.k.a *end* the Wise Men or the Study Group *end* This group of men
actually run the United States *end* I know a good deal about the Study Group in fact if my sources are
correct it isn’t a formal group anymore *end* There are not formal meetings but rather meetings happen at
random with people "accidently bumping into each other." MJ- draws members from the Jason
Society and the Jason Group *end* Both the Jason Society and the Jason Group are named after Jason and
the Golden fleece *end* There are reasons to believe that Jackie knew some of the way the power structure
operated *end* Jackie was good friends with many of the top Illuminati men in this nation *end* In fact she
ended up marrying Onassis who was a King in Moriah the Illuminati *end* Could Jackie have meant in
this poem that Jack was wanting to climb the ladder clear up to The Golden Fleece i.e *end* the Jason
Society and MJ- *end*
JOSEPH KENNEDY

Joseph Kennedy was John F *end* Kennedy’s father *end* Through various means I independently learned that
Joseph Kennedy was part of the Illuminati *end* He was a member of the Pilgrim Society a  of the
branch Illuminati *end* He also worked closely with the Mafia and other Kingpins in the Illuminati *end* Perhaps in another article we can cover more about Joseph Kennedy *end* This article is about long enough *end* I thought I might wrap it up with a story about Joseph Kennedy *end* The story demonstrates that much of
what politicians tell the public is simply for their own benefit and often only lies *end* Jack Kennedy got
the reputation after Britain and the Germany began fighting in W.W *end* II as being against the United
States entering the war *end* Jack Kennedy held the prestigious job of being the U.S *end* ambassador to Great
Britain at the time *end* The fact that Jack Kennedy was given such an extremely vital position shows that
the Kennedy family is important within the Illuminati *end* At that point in time like no other time it was
important who the U.S *end* had as ambassador *end* After the war began and both countries had martial law
and extensive military communications the ambassador was really not quite so critical in his role *end* One
of the men who worked at the embassy for the Americans was an American Tyler Gatewood Kent a



career officer in the U.S *end* Consular service *end* Tyler Kent believed in a world conspiracy before he began
working in the code room *end* While he worked there he was astonished that Roosevelt was secretly
involving the United States in W.W *end* II and lying to the American public *end* Further Roosevelt was
pulling strings to get us involved while lying to the public *end* Kent secretly took  pgs *end* of secret
documents which he was going to show to the public to expose the conspiracy *end* Kent never made it *end* He was arrested *end* In order for the British to hold him Jack Kennedy had to revoke his diplomatic
immunity on May   *end* Ambassador Joe Kennedy did that so he could receive a harsh sentence
because if he had been brought back to America the public might have gotten outraged at what the
politicians had done *end* According to Standard Operating Procedure and protocol Kent should have
stood trial in the U.S *end* The papers he had taken were American embassy papers not British *end* Although
the court records show that no evidence was introduced that Kent was a spy Joseph Kennedy later
would concoct a long story for the public that Kent was a Nazi spy *end* Kennedy went on speaking
engagements around the U.S *end* after he was relieved of his Ambassador post and Kennedy made it
sound like he was whole heartedly against the war *end* If Kennedy had really been against the war if he
had simply denied the British the chance to keep Kent Kent could have spilled the beans about what
Roosevelt was doing and the outraged would have destroyed Roosevelt’s chances to fool the American
people *end* Instead Roosevelt was able to proceed and develop the elements for the Pearl Harbor attack *end* While Kennedy pretended to be against the war he was serving as an intimate accomplice in
maneuvers designed to fool the American people *end* This is a good example of how even today the
public is looking to certain public officials to save them *end* They think that these politicians will try
everything possible to help them fight the system so when they fail to beat the system the people
think they have been beaten fairly *end* TO BE CONTINUED ---

REVISITING THE TOP  ILLUMINATI KENNEDY FAMILY

The intention originally was to have the artide on the top Illuminati Kennedy family in two parts *end* Perhaps sometime a second part can come out *end* So far I have only exposed a small part of the
Illuminati Kennedy. *end* As might be expected of any "good" Illuminati family the Kennedy *end* are
connected to drugs to the Monarch program to "death" euthanasia programs to the British monarchy
and to the various organized crimes group *end* mafias etc *end* For this issue I merely want to cover a few
aspects of the Kennedy family which I didn’t take the time to cover in the May  ’ issue *end* One
aspect is the connection of the Illuminati Kennedys to the drug trade and another is their connection to
"death" care and the Knights of Malta *end* Readers are invited to read more about the Knights of Malta in
one of the last articles in this newsletter *end*
After W.W *end* I Joseph Kennedy worked for Galen Stone who was a partner in the prominent firm of
Hayden Stone & Co *end* Hayden Stone & Co *end* had ties to the Rothschilds *end* In order to gain respectability
Joe married into the Fitzgerald family *end* This is a common Illuminati tactic *end* It seems many of the
Illuminati men look for a wife who will gain them respectability *end* Often wives like this are not even
brought into the Illuminati activities so that they can be the best cover possible *end* Kennedy’s mob
connection has been written about but perhaps two are worth pointing out again *end* Joseph Linsey who
was a kingpin of organized crime in New England and a pardter in crime with Meyer Lan sky was a
crime business pardner with Joseph Kennedy *end* Joseph Linsey in fact was listed as the top contributor to
Ted Kennedy’s Senate race one year *end* André Meyer head of the Meyer family was manager of the
Kennedy estates *end* One other business pardner of Kennedy was the Bronfmans who are powerful
Illuminati figures in Canada *end* Kennedy was in business with Newark’s Reinfield Syndicate of which
the Bronfman’s owned % *end* Winston Churchill whose connections to the elite are brought out in
other newsletters personally gave the grant to Joe Kennedy which gave him the Brit *end* alcoholic
distiller’s franchise for the American market *end* After Joe Kennedy became the Amer *end* Ambassador to
Britain we can catch a glimpse of how powerful the Illuminati are *end* The British Royal Family at the
request of Joseph Kennedy put on their full royal regalia for the Kennedy family *end* When Kennedy
arrived in Britain as American ambassador he contacted the Astors and the Sassoons *end* Sir John
Wheeler-Bennett founder and head of RIIA’s research division is credited by those in the know as
having written Kennedy’s master thesis which was later made into a book Why Engand Slept *end* Perhaps one of the items that best shows the hidden power behind Kennedy is his daughters marriage
to William Cavendish and Joseph Kennedy’s comments about it *end* Kathleen married the Duke of
Devonshire *end* The Duke of Devonshire was very prestigious position within the British nobility *end* Dukes
are second only to the monarchy *end* Joseph Kennedy was often heard saying *end* "If Kathleen and her



husband were living I’d be the father of the Duchess of Devonshire first Lady-in-Waiting to the
Queen and the father-in-law of the head of all the Masons in the world." Koskoff David E *end* Joseph P *end* Kennedy A Life and Times *end* Englewood Cliffs NJ Prentice-Hall Inc *end* p *end*  *end* Joseph Kennedy was
in the British branch of the Knights of Malta which is called the Order of St *end* John *end* Interestingly
Jackie Bouvier Kennedy Onassis’ sister Lee married Prince Stanislaus Radziwill *end* The Radziwill
family established the Order of St *end* John of Jerusalem that’s the Knights of Malta in Poland in  *end* They also helped establish the Order in the U.S *end* See the article on the Knights of Malta this issue *end* Another tie in between the Kennedies and the Knights of Malta concerns the Hospice movement *end* The
Kennedy Institute for the Study of Human Reproduction and Bioethics located at the Jesuit’s
Georgetown Univ *end* is helping fund the Knights of Malta’s hospice movement in America *end* In Oct *end*  the first annual meeting of the National Hospice Organization took place *end* Sen *end* Edward Kennedy
was one of the two keynote speakers *end* What is the hospice movement which is being conducted by the
Hospitallers one of the names the Knights of Malta go by *end* It is a movement to allow old people "The
Right to Die.’ The Knights of Malta have an ancient history of running drugs and in administering
mind altering drugs in their hospitals instead of giving medicine *end* This ancient activity was carried
forth into modern times when their St *end* Christopher’s hospital in London began giving patients
Brompton Mixture until they died *end* Brompton Mixture consists of heroin cocaine alcohol
tranquilizers and chloroform water *end* This mixture is given in the Knights of Malta hospitals to patients
every three hours until they die *end* Euthanasia or "mercy killing" may seem like a merciful idea until a
person finds out how the people at the top of the Euthanasia movement view things *end* They view things
similar to the satanist Adolf Hitier *end* This view is that it is merciful to get rid of unwanted people *end* Although the "death" hospice movement seems benevolent at first it is the conclusion of where the
program will end up that is the kicker *end* Hospice Inc *end* which is linked to the elite is also provided
funding by the Kaiser Foundation *end* Besides ties to running drugs the Kennedy Clan has had their
problems with drugs *end* Ted Kennedy’s daughter Kara was on drugs and ended up in a halfway house *end* Bobby Kennedy’s kids were busted for drugs *end* Joan Kennedy was having problems with alcoholism *end* David Kennedy and Robert F *end* Kennedy Jr *end* both have been addicted to hard drugs in spite of repeated
treatments in detoxification centers *end* David later "O-D"ed overdosed on cocaine and died in  *end* Pat’s Kennedy Lawford’s husband was dependent on drugs and alcohol *end* It is not well known that the
Illuminati have long used drugs *end* Elite people such as the Rothschilds Winston Churchill in London
and the Royal Family were using all cocaine heroin and opium not to mention occult ceremonies
too *end* Queen Victoria thought by many to be such a straight laced lady and her guests regularly used
large quantities of cocaine and heroin *end* The royal summer residence was Balmoral and this was the site
of frequent drug use and one has to wonder what else *end*
SHORT SUMMARY

This revisit to the Kennedy’s shows some of their ties to other elements of the Illuminati’s vast
scheme of things *end* Until people begin to recognize that the Kennedy’s wielded an occult power via
their bloodline they will not begin to appreciate why the Queen of England and her family would
honor a request from an Irish commoner to have her family dress up in full regalia for the pleasure of
this commoner’s family *end*
The friendship Winston Churchill had with Billy Graham  with Joe Kennedy and his very close
relationship with Onassis have recently been discussed *end* Churchill was an active Freemason *end* He also
was a Druid This is the picture of Churchill joininq the Albion Lodge of the Anc Order of Druids at
Blenheim  Aug *end*  *end*

FOLLOWUP ON THE KENNEDY FAMILY

There has been new attention focussed on the Kennedys *end* JFK’s widow died and then his mother Rose
has also died recently *end* Last year I read a book which was very well researched *end* It is entitled A
Question of Character A Life of John F *end* Kennedy by Thomas C *end* Reeves *end* The book does away with all
the propagands media hype and lies and tells the truth about the Kennedys *end* The book is well
documented *end* The author spent a great deal of energy trying to find out the truth about JFK *end* What
emerges is not public image that is so well known *end* JFK had only about a  I.Q *end* did very poorly in



school and could barely spell *end* JFK’s father had the wealth and connections to buy his son anything *end* Although Kennedy had a back problem which made him almost crippled his father got him into the
Navy during W.W *end* II *end* When he was let in the examining doctors looked the other way at his back
problem which plagued him his entire life *end* Kennedy got a commission as a Naval officer without
having to go through the normal channels of training and being commissioned *end* As a naval officer he
did a poor job and the great PT- story was far different than what the public has been lead to
believe *end* The fact that Kennedy let his boat be run over by a Jap destroyer was because he and his crew
weren’t paying attention sleeping hungover etc *end* Kennedy realized he might be court martialed for
his negligence but his father had the money to turn disaster into a story that made Kennedy into a
hero *end*
Some of the things you will learn from the book follow *end* In the chapter The Founding Family we learn
about PJ *end* Kennedy who was JFK’s grandfather *end* He dropped out of grammar school but by the age of
 he somehow had ownership of a saloon and a liquor business *end* Later he sold his liquor interests and
went into banking *end* He also went into politics and via corruption was a successful politician *end* He won
elections by hiring men to vote repeatedly for him *end* Joe Kennedy remembered  Ward heelers proudiy
telling Joe Kennedy’s father who was on the election commission "Pat we voted  times today."
Joe PJ’s son married Rose Fitzgerald *end* The Fitzgeralds were a mighty Italian clan that had helped
William the Conqueror become ruler of England *end* Honey Fitz was her father and he had a reputation
for graft and vote fraud as well as a not so secret notorious affair with a girl named "Toodles." Rose
got her education in the Catholic Sacred Heart Convent which she completed a month before her
birthday *end* Her father was removed from the House of Representatives after voting fraud was
uncovered *end* Joe was acquainted with Roosevelt when FDR was only an Ass *end* Secretary of the Navy *end* Joe
became an insider with the stock market and knew how to manipulate stock prices to fleece the small
fish that tried to play the stock market *end* Various gangster reported that during prohibition they had
smuggled illegal liquor into the U.S *end* with Joe Kennedy *end* Joe worked with David Sarnoff and his Radio
Corp *end* of America *end* Joe had an extremely varied sexual life; he had affairs with countless women and
his son JFK followed in his footsteps *end* Joe bought a  room nine bath home in Hyannis Port Mass *end* on Nantucket Sound *end* This became a favorite summer home of the Kennedy clan *end* He also bought a six-
bedroom Spanish style house on the fashionable North Ocean Boulevard in Palm Beach FL which
became the clan’s winter home *end* Rose is described as ‘self-centered stingy prudish *end* and often
spiteful.’ Her servants called her "madame" *end* Rather than being the model mother that is pictured to the
American public by the Kennedys she was often gone *end* JFK told his mother off at age  "Gee you’re
a great mother to go away and leave your children alone." As an adult JFK confided to a friend *end* "My
mother was either at some Paris fashion house or else on her knees in some church *end* She was never
there when we really needed her....My mother never really held me and hugged me *end* Never *end* Never!’
Further his father’s lack of respect for his mother led JFK to say "My mother is a nothing." p *end* Imagine growing up without a mother to hug and kiss you *end* JFK’s father ‘tolerated littie nonsense and
no disobedience." p *end* The life JFK lived at home was not a life of compassion but one of rigid
obedience *end* The children were stripped of many things ordinary children would have *end* They didn’t even
have their own rooms *end* p *end*  Most children have a room of their own sometime in which to place
their belongings and nick-nacks *end* The few times JFK as a boy invited friends over they were
frightened to death at how his father would fly into a rage and give the Kennedy boys a tongue-
lashing *end* The children were not allowed to express pain *end* For instance when one of the Kennedy’s were
hurt and came to his mother for sympathy she ordered ‘On your feet now you know how to behave *end* Go out there and behave as you know you should.’ It is highly likely this strictness was related to
some type of mind-control which even then was practiced by Satanic families *end* Joe had his daughter
given a prefrontal lobotomy and then banished to a nursing convent *end* From then on his daughter
Rosemary did not exist *end* One wonders what the full story was about Rosemary *end* Was she sexually
abused as is done to so many of the elite’s daughters of Satanic families *end* Felix Frankfurter who played
such a prominent role with Charles T *end* Russell was a good friend of Joe’s *end*
JFK managed to hide from the public during his life the fact that he wore glasses and also to some
degree his intense back pain which hurt him intensely *end* On page  we learn that JFK was unable to
ever have a self-revealing conversation *end* JFK had a total lack of ability to relate everything was very



surface in his relations with people *end* He was very skilled at picking up women and getting them to
bed *end* And he had many good friends *end* However he didn’t have the ability to love or relate to others *end* This is another clue that he may have had some type of SRA abuse *end* On page  Reeves writes ‘At
the root of it were months of loneliness and their parents often selfish insensitive behavior." But I
wonder if it didn’t go deeper *end* From what I know from informers it goes deeper and involves SRA *end* JFK
wasn’t even told of his brother Teddy’s birth until he came home from boarding school and
discovered he had another brother *end* JFK was very unsuccessful at most everything he did *end* His father
had so much influence and power that he could get his son out of almost any difficulty *end* A friend of
JFK’s recalled "With Jack nobody really admired what he did or respected what he did but they liked
his personality *end* When he flashed his smile he could charm a bird off a tree." At the age of  Jack
went to Harlem to a brothel *end* Later he nicknamed his sexual organ JJ." Meanwhile his father was the
chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and an informal adviser to Pres *end* Franklin
D *end* Roosevelt *end* I might add here that if you look closely you will find the Illuminati Kings are the
advisers to the Presidents *end* I have mentioned some of these already like in the article on the Bundy
Illuminati family *end* Another example may be found in the book The Old Boys- The American Elite &
The Origins of the CIA by Burton Hersh *end* On page  of The Old Boys we learn that President
Eisenhower’s Special Assistant for Cold War Strategy was Nelson Rockefeller *end* The most dangerous
situation this country has ever been in was the threat of the Russian military and who was the primary
advisor to our President Eisenhower during his term as a U.S *end* President during the Cold War *end* Iliuminati King Nelson Rockefeller *end* JFK went for one year to the London School of Economics
according to the story given the public *end* Actually he went there for one month didn’t do any academic
work and came back home *end* But it is significant that his father tried to send him to a school in which so
many of the elite have gone to *end* JFK had help in writing and putting out a book entitled Why England
Slept Henry Luce who headed Time-Life and who was a good friend of Joe Kennedy gave the book
good publicity in Time magazine and his father bought between  to  of the books and
stored them in the attic and basement of his Hyannis Port home in order to make Jack’s JFK book a
best seller *end* When JFK went to California in  one of the places he stayed at was with William
Randolph Hearst who is another Illuminati figure at his coastal castle *end* Hearst would give help to
Kennedy later on too *end* When Kennedy ran in politics Heart’s Boston American wouldn’t even accept
Kennedy’s opponent’s paid political advertisements *end* Joe Kennedy worked for the FBI after W.W.II *end* p *end*  JFK’s favorite sister Kathleen married William Harrington who father was the tenth duke of
Devonshire a pillar of the Church of England called the Episcopalian church in the US *end* and a high
ranking Freemason *end* After marrying him she had an affair with aristocrat Peter Milton Lord
Fitzwilllam *end* After Joe Jr *end* died JFK’s father started grooming JFK to become President *end* After Jack
was elected to the House of Representatives his three best congressional friends were Richard Russell
Spessard Holland and Robert A *end* Taft *end* Notice that two of these are from well-known illuminati
families the Tafts and the Russells *end* By the way the occult Tafts and occult Russell families have
intermarried *end* Because there is so much disinformation out about the people who run this country it
must sometimes seem rather bizarre that people like me come along and say there is a satanic
conspiracy of great magnitude *end* If Americans were as a whole critical thinkers and would challenge the
propaganda that the controlled media gives them then the false fronts and false public images of their
leaders might not get written up so easily as history *end* There are not many critical thinkers in this nation *end* There are a great many intelligent people but not a great many critical thinkers *end* A conspiracy of great
magnitude has had this nation in its grips since the nation was founded and the controlled press has
managed to prevent the general population from finding this conspiracy out *end* The Kennedy Family has
played a role in that conspiracy *end* JFK gave his life to that conspiracy *end* The assassination of JFK is one
of the best ways to introduce Americans to the conspiracy *end* Ralph Epperson who gives
taiks/slideshows about the NWO to groups likes to use the Kennedy Assassination as a method to get
people to realize that there is a NWO conspiracy *end* Interestingly Ralph Epperson had as a companion
for a while without knowing it an active Monarch slave who helped him give presentations *end* It is
difficult for those exposing the NWO to get away from being infiltrated *end* The Monarch mind-
controlled slaves are very difficult to detect especially since most people don’t even know that they
exist *end*


 The co-editor of this on-line book talked to Epperson and he denies this and says the woman was
an SRA victim and thought herself to be some government project but not a Monarch victim *end* editor's

Bloodlines of Illuminati

By

Fritz Springmeier

The Li Family

In writing about the Li family and Chinese secret societies I am like the man who wakes up in the
middle of the night while everyone else sleeps and then gropes around in the darkness trying to feel
his way *end* I can share with you what I’ve learned but undoubtedly there is a great deal more that can be
learned *end*
When the year started I knew only a little about the Li family and that only from what I had heard *end* I
didn’t even know how to spell their name right *end* I was spelling it Lee Actually the Li family name is
spelled Lee in some areas such as Hokkien Teochew Singapore and by some chinese Americans *end* Because I knew so little  about the family it was one of my primary areas of focus when doing

UNDERSTANDING HOW CHINESE NAMES ARE JOINED

A Chinese is name is made up of a family name surname which is written first and then comes the
personal name *end* In the chinese way of things my name would be Springmeier Fritz *end* Family names are
usually of one character each although there are exceptions like Ouyong and Situ *end* There are over
 Chinese surnames for about I billion Chinese *end* The more frequent chinese surnames in English
speaking countries such as the U.S *end* U.K *end* & Aust *end* are Chan Lin Li Wong Huang Mei Yang
Chin and Fong *end* In mainland China the  top families are Chen Li Zhang He and Huang *end*


FAMILY NAMES ARE MORE MEANINGFUL FOR CHINESE IN CHINA THAN FOR
AMERICANS

The chinese surname Li is a very popular name in China perhaps not as widespread as Smith in this
country but certainly used as much as the name Brown is in America *end* Chinese who have the same
surname have much more loyalty to someone else who has the same surname *end* For instance two
chinese with the Li name would consider themselves relatives even if they were total strangers *end* Even
if two people knew no blood ties if they had the same surname it has generally been considered
incestuous to marry each other in China *end* In the U.S *end* if two Browns without any apparent blood ties
met each other they would not feel as if they were close relatives which two Chinese with the same
surname would *end*
The Li surname has a long history which goes back to a specific person named Emperor Zhuanzu
who was the first Li and lived before  B.C *end* This is according to the Xing Zuan the chinese
dictionary of surnames *end*
The Li family has a long history in China with many stories *end* During the Tang Dynasty about
different surnames were given the honor of having the Li surname *end* Li Yuan was the founder of the
Tang Dynasty which lasted from  to  A.D *end* His son who ruled after him was Li Shimin *end* In their
dynasty printing and paper money were introduced to China *end* It’s interesting that the Li’s are
connected the introduction of paper money *end*




ARE THE DIFFERENT IMPORTANT LI’S RELATED *end*
In recent history three Li’s stand out as giants *end*
· The billionaire and de facto ruler of Hong Kong Li Ka-shing *end*
· Li Peng the ruler of Red China *end*
· Lee Kuan Yew President & dictator of Singapore



I don’t know which of the Li’s are closely related and which are not *end* I do know that Li’s control Red
China Hong Kong and Singapore and have important positions in Taiwan *end* If the various Li’s which
control these various nations are related then we are certainly looking at one of the most powerful
families in the world *end* In terms of power they would be just as powerful as the Rockefellers *end* They
also connect to secret occult societies but the secret societies which the Li’s are major players in are
the Chinese secret societies *end* Those will be covered elsewhere in this newsletter *end*
WHICH ONES ARE PART OF THE ILLUMINATI *end*
I have learned from a source that Li Ka-shing and the powerful Hong Kong Li’s are definitely part of
the Satanic llluminati Li’s *end* in terms of whether the Li’s who run Red China are part of the Illuminati
I know nothing that directly connects them *end* However there are clues that make one wonder *end* For
instance why do the Rockefellers and Rothschilds have such a cosy relationship with these Red
Chinese Li’s *end* Why does the Premier or Prime Minister of the People’s Republic of China Li Peng
visit with the Rockefellers and other capitalists when he comes to New York City if he is such a
hard-line communist *end* Haven’t the Communists named the CapitalIsts their major enemy *end* And then
when we watch men who are In the Illuminati such as Skull & Bones George Bush treat the Chinese
Li’s with such closeness even when it was Li Peng that crushed innocent people at Tiennamen
Square it makes us wonder still *end* In fact with other pieces of the puzzle that I have in place I do
know that Red China is already cooperating with and part of the New World Order *end* The only way that
China could already be secretly part of the New World Order Is for it’s leaders who are the Li family
to be in favor of the New World Order *end* This strongly suggests that the Li family In China is also part
of the Illuminati *end* From what I know the range of possibilIties range from them being only
sympathizers with the NWO elite to them being outright members of the Illuminati *end* I lean toward the
latter view *end*
Then there is Singapore *end* Singapore is lock stock and barrel in the New World Order *end* They went to a
cashless Society before anyone else *end* One of the Li family who spells his name Lee Lee Kuan Yew a
Cambridge-educated lawryer was dictator of Singapore for decades *end* He has ties to the British elite *end* As an example of his dictatorship Lee didn’t like long hair on men and so men coming into
Singapore with long hair would have their passports taken away and either got a haircut or went to
jail *end* In  when Brittain gave Singapore its Independence the Li family In this case also spelled
Lee controlled the People’s Action Party which ruled the country *end* In  the People’s Action Party
monopolized politics so much that they won all  seats for Parliament *end* Lee Kuan Yew was placed
into the all-powerful position of President in  where he remained I belIeve until  *end* Singapore’s leaders made Singapore very anti-communist during the cold war and when Nixon
began his trips to woo China *end* Singapore began making goodwill political mission to China *end* In
Lee’s henchman Foreign Minister S *end* Rajaratnam went to China and met with Chou En-lai *end* Chou En-
lai was the mentor and friend of U Peng *end*


U Peng’s early life *end*


Actually to be more specific after Li Peng’s father who was a leading communist was shot by the
nationalists In  Chou Enlal more or less adopted Li Peng and raised him *end* Chou Enlal got U Peng
into Moscow’s school system where when the Russians finally realized his brilliance wanted to keep
Li Peng and train him for their own purposes and U had to escape to back to China *end* For whatever
reasons Li Peng was an advocate of the Soviet style of economics *end* Before being placed into his
prominent position that he holds today Li Peng managed China’s economy for many years *end*


Lee met Mao

In  Lee Kuan Yew himself met with Mao Tse-Tung then the leader of Red China *end* Mao
Tsetuag himself is closely tied to the Li family *end* Li Ta-chao was the head of the communist party in
Northern China during the fighting with the Nationalists *end* Mao’s bodyguard was a Li family member
Li Yinqiao *end* Mao’s mentor was Li Ta-chao who had ties to the Red Spears Secret Society *end* Other early
high ranking communists such as Chu Teh Ho Lung and Liu Chib-tan had memberships in the Red
Spears Secret Society and Li Ch’l-han an early communist leader was a member of the Green Gang
Secret Society *end* We will cover more about the Li family and Its relationship to Chinese Secret
Societies later as weil as explaining some about the various powerful secret fraternities *end* It may well
have been Li Ta-chao’s guidance that lead to Mao Tse-tung writing the first systematic attempt by a
Chinese Marxist to characterize the class basis of secret societies and emphasizing their importance
for revolution *end* Mao cooperated with the Ko-Ino Hui a secret society that helped his revolution but
strangely the official collection of Mao’s works neglects to include Mao’s appeal to them for help *end* This neglect is noted on pg *end*  of Popular Movements & Secret Societies in China *end* - Mao
Tse-Tung is also a product of the Harlot Christian church *end* Mao as a boy had wanted to learn of Christ
and attend a Missionary school but when he went to it they threw him rudely out because he was
Chinese *end* Mao never forgot the bad treatment he received at the hands of Christians *end* That explains in
part his hatred of Christianity *end*

One of the articles that I read to understand where Clinton was going with Red China was in the Jan-
Feb ’ issue of The China Business which had on its cover a picture of Clinton and Li Peng with the
question "A NEW ERA?" As many of the elite’s articles are it was long on rhetoric propaganda *end* etc *end* I think the bottom line was that Clinton is going to follow the advice of his China advisors and that
Clintom does not want to rock the boat in our relations with Communist China *end* The idea that is being
planted by the question on the cover is about the size of things the elite are moving us closer to their
"new era."



The Li Family and Chinese Secret Societies

In my investigation of the Triads I discovered that the Li family is one of the principal families which
has controlled it *end* The Triads is a ChInese Secret Society which is something of a cross between the
Masons and the Mafia— something in the line of P Freemasonry—except much bigger *end* The Triads
are not well known In this country but they are many more times powerful than the Mafia *end* It is known
that the Mafia was invited to work with the Triads in  and at the time the Mafia didn’t like the
Triads arrogance *end* However in my opinion the Triads were not being arrogant considering how
powerful they were at the time *end* I suggest the reader read the article on the Triads for more
understanding on this *end* For the sake of completeness I will list some of the Li’s past and present that
have been important Triad leaders *end*
see below I am not trying to weary you with all these strange names but in breaking new ground on
understanding this powerful Illuminati family if specific details are not given out we risk losing
some of the picture *end*

THE LI FAMILY AND GENETICS

The Li family has also provided some of the greatest scientists In the field of genetic research *end* Genetic research has been a avid interest of the Satanic Hierarchy *end*


SUMMARY

The facts I have of what is going on with the Li family are Just enough to provide us with the basic
picture *end* The Li family In Hong Kong is part of the Satanic Hierarchy and works hand in glove with
British and American elite *end* They also help run the Triads *end* Whether or not the Li’s in Hong Kong are
related to the Red Chinese Li’s who run China I do not know but it is clear that some Li’s run Red
China and also Singapore *end* Both these countries work hand in hand with the Satanic hierarchy so it
makes one suspicious as to whether their leaders are part of the hierarchy too *end* If these Li’s do
consider themselves blood relatives—which they might—we know that according to Chinese custom
they would do this to a great extent anyway then that makes the Li family an incredibly powerful
family of worldwide importance *end*

This article will primarily deal with the Triads which have so many other names it would take
pages upon pages to give them all *end* One of the names the Triads have had is the Heaven and
Earth Society *end* Other principal names include the Hung League and the Three United
Association *end*
The Freemasons have been very Interested in the Triads and several Masons have done in depth
studies and written books about the Thads including G *end* Schlegel The Hung League *end*  J.S.M *end* Ward The Hung Society - see another quote of his on pg *end*  and W.G *end* Sterling The Hung Society *end*

This article will be trimmed back—and perhaps some of the information can be provided In a future

The history of China is a history of authoritarian dynasties and the secret societies that opposed them *end* Throughout Chinese history there has basically been only one recourse to opposition to the
establishment that was through secret societies *end* Secret societies have been a way for the poweriess
to struggle against what ever they perceived as the cause of their misery *end* There has never been any
lack of recruits for chinese secret societies and there has never been any lack of causes to use to rally
the poor masses against for motivating people into joining secret societies *end* There seems to be no end
to the supply of men willing to lead secret societies also *end* In fact I know of over  Chinese secret
societies some of which are no longer in existence *end* Obviously we are not going to cover that many
secret societies in this article *end*
What criteria do I have for selecting what I will write about in this article *end* First I desire to show the
compatibility of Chinese secret societies to western secret societies *end* This compatibility is the reason
that the Triads can work with the Mafia the CIA and the Illuminati *end* These points of compatibility
explain how Freemasonry can work with some of the Chinese secret societies *end* For instance I have a
copy of The New Age magazine Sept *end*  p *end*  which is put out by The Supreme Council º
which states

‘Chinese Wootsu sic Society Compared to Freemasonry

‘Brother Morris B *end* de Pass ° Master of Kadosh of the Peking Scottish Rite Bodies in his annual
report includes the following interesting story in regard to Wootsu Society *end* ‘During the past year I
had the pleasure of meeting an ‘Old China Hand’ himself a Scottish Rite Mason who learning of my
China background asked me If I had any knowledge of an old Chinese organization similar to
Masonry *end* I felt certain he had in mind the ‘Wootsu Society’ Woo meaning  and Tsu meaning
‘Ancestor’ or in English ‘the Society of the Five Ancestors *end* "...some fornignors living in China .. *end* were of the opinion that The Society of the Five Ancestors was the Eastern Branch of that movement
which developed in Western countries into Freemasonry ... *end* The tenets of the Wootsu Society do have
much in common with those of Freemasonry *end* They pay homage to Buddha whom they accept as the



incarnation of a Supreme Deity they believe in immortality they teach ‘Faithfulness unto Death’; and
they practice secrecy *end* The Society differs from Masonry in that there is no counterpart of the Volume
of the Sacred Law as being an indispensable part of its Furniture; .. *end* and it is open to both men and
women.’

Perhaps no one better epitomizes the connections and overlap between East and West occult secret
societies than the life of Sun-Yat-Sen *end* Sun-Yat-Sen led China to overthrow the monarchy and create a
republic *end* Sun-YatSen was a leader in several Triad groups such as the Hong Kong based Chung Wo
Tong Society and the Kwok On Wui Society in Honolulu and Chicago *end* Soon after arriving in Hawaii
he formed the Tai Luk Shan a new Triad group *end* Sun-Yat-Sen played the key role in setting up
other branches of the Triads too *end* In Japan he set up the T’ung Meng Hui *end* In Singapore and Malaysla
he set up Triad lodges too *end* He was a high ranking Freemason and he attended an Anglican school in
Hong Kong *end* Sun-Yat-Sen and the millionaire Chang ChingChang who was an international art dealer
worked together *end* Sun-Yat-Sen travelled in the US *end* and Europe gaining support for his revolution *end* Several other great non-Communist Chinese leaders have also had membership in both the Triads and
Freemasonry *end*


TRIAD RITUALS

Triad rituals were an elaborate affair but have continued to be streamlined over the years *end* The ritual
initiation drew from  religious sources Taoism magic Buddhism and what might be called
Confucianism *end* Taoism emphasized the importance of blood ancestry of magic and alchemy *end* The
traditional initiation lasts about eight hours and includes ritual dance secret hand-shakes a blood
sacrifice and pricking the finger of the new initiates *end*
The Triads have an extremely long history and a lot of heritage *end* In order to try to capsulize what they
are one has to look at what they are doing at a particular moment *end* At times they are secret fraternity
like the Masons at other times they have more of the appearance of a revolutionary army and at
other times they look like the Mafia *end* They are all these things *end* And so they are a much more complex
group to understand than some of the other secret societies that might fit into some nice label *end* Sometimes their services as hit men are hired out to others *end* Their heritage and history make them
almost a sub-culture and a sub-culture that is difficult for law enforcement agencies to penetrate *end* Their blood oaths and traditions bind them together *end*


ORIGINS

The White Lotus Society centuries ago amalgamated itself to the Hung Society which in turn changed
into the Triad Society also known as the Three United Society *end* Some people continued calling it the
Hung Society *end* The Hung Society had many local names and like Freemasonry hid behind trade
guilds *end*


INFILTRATED THE BOXERS

The Triads infiltrated the Boxers and even associated with them but the Boxers lost against the
foreign powers *end*


SET UP BRANCHES IN THE UNITED STATES

During the California gold rush days many Chinese began coming to America *end* Triad lodges sprang
up in the chinese laundrymen of San Francisco *end* By  the Triad Society called ‘Five Companies’



had  members in California *end* In the U.S *end* the Triad lodges became known as Tongs-which
means a ‘hail’ or ‘meeting place.’ Whereever the Chinese lived they quietly set up Triad lodges so
that soon there were lodges In Laramle Cheyenne Kansas City Seattle Vancouver California New
York Boston and the Klondike *end* These overseas Triads came under the jurisdiction of the Hung Mun
Society in Canton *end* This Triad group was in turn under Chi Kung Tong group *end* Groups got started in
Australia and Malaya *end*


TRIADS & HONG KONG

When the British began ruling Hong Kong the Hong Kong area already had a reputation for being a
haven for pirates and the Triads established lodges and began secretly to rule *end* In  the British
made membership in the Triads illegal and in later years deported them back to communist China for
those Triad members found *end* However the Triads controlled things and the British never were able to
enforce that iaw except for some scattered arrests *end* For Instance in the s % of the police in
Hong Kong were affiliated with the Triads *end*
In fact the Britishman Ernest Taffy’ Hunt the Police Superintendent of the Thad Bureau of the
Colony of Hong Kong was paid bribes for  years ranging from about HK to HK  per
year starting in  *end*
The Hong Kong papers every so often report police raids against the Triads but one has to wonder
how much is interrivalry between Triad groups and much is just for show and how much is really
something hurting the Triads *end*
Under Triad control factories in Hong Kong have been turning out items for sex shops worldwide *end* The living conditions of areas under Triad control in Hong Kong were literal hells on earth *end* The
Triads packed people in the sanitation was negligible the filth overwhelming and the corruption of
the human spirit complete *end* There is no question what kind of life the Triads want to bring people
total degeneration into total moral corruption and filth *end* Like the Masons but to a much lesser degree
there have been a few Triad mutual aid societies for their own members but in general these have
been rare *end*
The Triads have exacted extortion money from almost everyone in Hong Kong *end* The history of their
extortions and threats etc *end* is many books long *end* In short the whole trading economy of Hong Kong
was under their power *end* And the Li family as now working with them *end* See the Li article in this issue *end*
Various scandals over the decades have repeatedly shown that the Triads have totally infiltrated the
Hong Kong government and police force *end* Where ever ethnic chinese were hired the Triads infiltrated *end* And then even many of the non-Chinese were bought off *end* People in Hong Kong who have watched
the Triads do illegal acts right in public have frequentiy been frustrated by the lack of police response *end*


THE TRIADS & CHINA

Before the Communists took over the Triads ran China *end* For instance in  it was discovered that
the Triads along with the Vice-President of the Republic of China were stealing public funds to
purchase opium to deal in the drug trade *end* The leaders of Free China have been Triad leaders *end* Many of
them have also been Freemasons *end*
After the Communists took over the Triads had to go way underground *end* The communists never
stopped the Triads but they did make them much more secret *end* You may remember when the
Tiananmen Square Massacre occured the newspapers quietly reported that the Triads had smuggled
the leaders of the democratic movement out of Red China *end* As was just said the Communists have
never broken the power of the Triads *end* In fact not only has the brutal Red Chinese government been



ineffective against the Triads most of the police everywhere have been *end* The Triads are the most
powerful criminal fraternal group in the world except for the IllumInati and the families that make up
the Illuminati’s Committee of  *end* The Mafia Is small peanuts compared to the Triads *end* The Triads are
almost untouchable by any law enforcement group *end* For instance in Great Britain the British do not
have hardly any ethnic Chinese on their police force to even try infiltrating the Triads *end*
The Triads have operated in the United States for over  years and are major drug handiers
working in cooperation with the Illuminati Kings and most Americans do not even know they exist *end* And although America has ethnic chinese Americans of Chinese descent do not speak the Chinese
dialects that undercover agents would have to know to break into the Triad operations *end*


DIFFERENT TRIAD GROUPS

There are numerous Triad groups *end* By  there were eight main Triad groups and they had divided
Hong Kong up into geographic areas and ethnic groups that each was responsible to control *end* The
eight main ones at that time were the Wo the rung the Tung the Chuen the Shing the Fuk Yee
Hing the Yee On and the Luen *end* Each had its own headquarters its own sub-societies and its own
public covers *end* The Fuk Yee Hing’s cover was that it was registered as a benevolent society for
workers *end* It had  branch offices and a membership of  *end* Yee On’s cover was as the Yee On
Commercial and Industrial Guild *end* The Wo operated as Death Gratuity associations *end* Any way each
found some cover to hide behind *end* Most of the Martial Arts dubs were fronts or affiliations with the
Triads and continue to be not only in Hong Kong but to some degree in other countries too *end*
As an example of how divided the Triad groups are--one of the large ones the Wo Society was itself
split into three major factions Wo Shing Tong Wo Yung Yee and Wo Hop To which for years
struggled for domination of the Wo Society *end* By the late s there were  affiliated organaizations
to the Wo Society Triad *end* Today the Wo Shing Wo is the most powerful of the Wo group Triads *end*
One of the Triad groups that works with the Illuminati is the Sun Yee On aka Yee On Commercial
and Industrial Guild *end* Sun Vee On was the prime controller of the Kowloon Walled City which
produced sex toys for the international market *end*
Besides the Wo Shing Wo and the Sun Yee On the third great Triad societies of modern times Is the
K Society *end* Probably Chiang Kai-shek and his mentor Big-Eared Tu were responsible for setting up
a league to oversee all the various Triad groups called Five Continents Overseas Chinese Hung
League *end* This was set up In  when the Chinese operated in Asia North America South America
Europe and Africa *end*
As a side note on Tu one of his friends was Charlie Soong an office-bearer for the Triads who had
attended Vanderbilt Universisty at the expense of millionaire Julian S *end* Can *end* Chalie Soong’s daughter
Al-lag had connections to Sun-Yat-Sen and also became helpful to the Triads when she married
Kung Hsiang-hsi a banker and businessman *end* The Kung banking empire along with the Soong’s
veneer of Christianity which came from their Methodist Church membership helped this branch of
Triads in their international dealings *end*
Today in Hong Kong there may be as many as  different Triad Societies operating *end* The largest
numerically is the Sun Yee On with  members *end* These  Societies can be classed into three
different styles *end* The first is the traditional structure *end* The second type are those who are totally
unstructured *end* The third type is the most dangerous they are small closely knit cells or central
committees who plan out criminal activity with acute business-like efficiency *end*


LARGE BASES OF TRIAD OPERATIONS



Vancouver B.C *end* San Francisco New York London Manchestor and Amsterdam not to mention
Macao and Hong Kong are some of the big bases of Triad Operation *end* Money is made by extortion
gambling prostitution drugs or any other way to make a profit *end* The Triads have worked with the
CIA in creating the drug network *end* The creation of the Golden Triangle as a source for drugs was a
joint CIA-Triad operation *end* The Chinese communists couldn’t pass up the opportunity to debauch
America *end* The Red Chinese government has secretly worked with the Triads in supplying heroin and
opium knowing that these drugs were going to U.S *end* military bases *end* U.S *end* garrisons In Germany were
supplied high grade drugs that came through the Triads either grown under Triad supervision or in
places like Red China *end* One of the kingpins in this drug trade was Lumpy Ho whose business fronts
were known as the Dutch Connection *end*
The corrupt police-officers that were Triad members that fled anti-corruption drives in Hong Kong
would flee to Vancouver B.C *end* where they have spent their efforts building that area up as a large
Triad base of operations *end* Actually they have branched out into Victoria and Seattle WA *end*
The Triads are known to have been operating in London since the s and may have been
operating even before that *end* It wasn’t until the  *end* drug culture that the Triads began to catch more
attention due to their large involvement in the drug trade *end* In  the Triads introduced Pure No *end*
herein into England to replace the ‘Brown Sugar’ that the Rolling Stones sang about *end*
In  the British authorities moved against the Americans and British agents on the Drug Squad
and forced some resignations *end* It is not exactly clear what the details of the whole mess were but the
process was that for  years there was essentially no coherent drug squad in London *end*
Every locality In England where ethnic chinese are located the Triads have some type of operation *end* This means all of the British cities *end* In Scotland and Ireland the different Triad groups have been
fighting each other for control of the territory *end* No wonder the Illuminati like the Triads *end* The U family
with their connections controlling the Triads have the perfect vehicle to operate the drug trade *end* If
anyone dislikes the drug trade their hate will directed to an ethnic group rather than realizing who
the real kings are *end* Most of the couriers for the Triads today are Europeans *end* And the Trade are using
British banks now more than the Hong Kong banks *end*
The British Parliament had a committee in  to look at the Triads *end* They reported that the Triads
posed no threat to the U.K

The Mafia had tried to maintain its position in the drugactivity but the Mafia wasn’t in a position to
buy directly from the prime sources *end* The Chiu Chau Triads had operated in Saigon and Vietnam
during the Vietnam war bringing in drugs for the American soldiers *end* The Corsican syndicates
organized crime had connections in Vietnam *end* They introduced the Mafia to the Triads *end* The
Corsicans had been known as the French connection in the drug trade *end* They had worked with supplies
coining from Turkey through Lebanon and then to Marseilles France *end* Now the Triads ship Asian
drugs to the U.S *end* via South America and the Triads control the drug trade in New York City almost
totally now *end* Dear in mind that the Triad leaders did this only after working out agreements with the
top llluminati families *end* If the top Illuminati families were not cooperating the Triads would be out of
business *end*
One of the strong-arm units ofa New York Triad group called Hip Sing Tong is the Flying Dragons *end* The On Lee Ong another N.Y *end* triad group’ has the Ghost Shadows as their strong-arm unit *end*
If one takes a city like Toronto Canada there the population of Chinese and Vietnamese is  at
least *end* This is a large pool of people from whith to build Triad lodges *end* There are  Triad Societies
operating in Canada *end*
In Australia the Triad society Yee Hing Soctety with its charitable Mun Ji
Dong has been listed as a "masonic charity" for  years *end* The Mun Ji Dong
has decided to operate legally *end*


PUBLIC CEREMONIES

The Triads would publicly celebrate the Goddess of Mercy and the God of the Earth each year at a
major festival where a bamboo bomb would be set off *end* At the  Tin Hau Festival *end* two groups of
the K Triad and  members of the Wo Shing Wo society openly wore Triad T-shirts at the
festival *end* This was publicly breaking the law that prohibits the Triads from publicly advertising but
the Triads got away with it with impunity *end*
ENFORCEMENT

The Triads’ tradition weapons are the meat cleaver and a razor-sharp butchers knife which they use to
slash people *end*
THE TRIADS INTERFACE WITH MANY OTHER GROUPS

Besides working with the CIA the Mafia who work for the Illuminati and working with the
Illuminati families themselves the Triads work with street gangs youth gangs and any other
organized crime group *end* They also have worked with all types of secret fraternal groups including the
Freemasons *end* Historically speaking they have cooperated numerous times with other Chinese secret
societies *end* The Triads also work with the Japanese organized crime group Yakusa and the Filipino
organized crime groups *end* The Ya.kusa also move drugs into the U.S *end* mainly via Hawaii *end* This is taking
place with Yakusa/Triad cooperation *end* The Taiwan Triad Societies work closest with the Yakusa
especially the Four Seas and United Bamboo Societies *end*
THE TRIADS IN BANKING

The Triads have their own accountants and so Triad financial operations are great for money
laundering *end* Stolen credit cards and imitation merchandise that look *end* like the real stuff are also money
makers for the Triad. *end* The Triads also have their own lawyers who are members of their societies *end* Besides making false Gucci handbags the Triads are adept at forging passports *end* One of the items that
the drug trade takes is gold because the drug producers want to be paid in gold *end* This trafficing in
gold must be watched by the Illuminati because gold has always been an important commodity for
the Satanic Hierarchy *end* It’s value to them goes beyond the monetary significance *end*
IN SUMMARY

The Triads are an occult fraternity which has developed into a major international organized crime
society *end* It has many agreements with various families of the Illuminati and works with them *end* The Li
family is taking a big role somewhere with the Triads but exactly what that role is I have not spelled
out yet *end*
The Li Family is represented in Salem OR & other West Coast cities by the Wong Family who are
part of their bloodline *end* Vol *end*  touches on the Wong Family & their part in organized crime *end*

Aristotle Onassis died in  *end* His son and heir to his throne died in  *end* My inside information
about the Onassis family being one of the top  goes back to the s and ’s *end* Is the family stili

with the Illuminati but I will attempt to give my readers a better understanding *end* My inside knowledge
of the occult side-that is the secret satanic ritual activIties of the family is sparse because my

Grand Orient was originally strong in Louisiana but spread Itself to many other US *end* locations *end* Garfield a very powerful man in the Grand Orient managed to become US *end* President because the
political process got deadlocked at the convention and the Masons suggested him as a compromise
candidate *end* Although Garfield was an extremely powerful Mason had been perhaps the youngest
general in the US *end* army during the Civil War the Illuminati ordered him shot after he had served
about a year in office as President *end* Garfield was reported by an eye-witness to Satanic rituals to have
participated in the cannibalistic rites of Satanism done to gain the spiritual power of the eaten person *end* The Grand Orient Freemasonry has been linked to other orders of Freemasonry that are also called
Rosicrucians *end* Pope John XXIII joined a Rosicrucian group that had links to European Freemasonry
when he was in Turkey *end* While the secret Grand Orient Freemasonry was very strong in Turkey in
spite of its small numbers the regular American Freemasonry granted a dispensation for a Masonic
Lodge to operate in Smyrna Turkey in May  but the charters were withdrawn on Aug *end*   *end* However it is interesting that of all the Turkish cities Smyrna was definitely the best place for
Freemasonry to gain recruits *end* Men like Achmed Pasha and many of the other Pasha family have been
leaders within Freemasonry and the Illuminati *end* Achmed Pasha was a Satanist and had a large harem *end* Mehmet Talaat Pasha - was a Freemason and part of the Turkish revolution of  *end* He
was the leader of the Young Turks which was a joint project of the Sufis and the Frankist Satanists *end* The type of Satanism led by the Frank family has had connections to Turkey for hundreds of years *end* Mehmet Talaat Pasha was the Grand Master of the Grand Orient of Turkey *end* He was held the political
position in Turkey of grand vizier of Turkey - *end* Another Turkish Pasha was part of the
Turkish royalty running Egypt when Egypt was part of the Ottoman Empire *end* His name was Khedive
Ismail Pasha and he was Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Egypt *end* It was this Turk Khedive Ismail
Pasha who gave the famous ObelIsk to the United States *end* This Obelisk was called Cleopatra’s Needle
and was originally erected in the city of the sun Heliopolis about  B.C *end* The Obelisk is a
representation of a human penis because sun worship worship of regeneration sex and worship of
the sun god Satan were all tied together *end* Masons helped with the moving of the obelisk and its
dedication when it arrived in New York City *end* Large obelisks have been erected by Masons in New
York Washington D.C *end* Paris the Vatican and London *end* If my memory serves me correct Berlin
received one too at one time *end*
Every morning when the United States President wakes up he can look out the window and see the
Masonic obelisk and be reminded of who controls America *end*  the President has any training in the
Mystery religion of ancient Egypt he will also know what body part is symbolically erected in the
Washington Memorial *end* If the United States were ever to return to serving God that monument would

be a good one to destroy *end* God asked the Israelites not just simply to avoid worshipping such
abominations He asked His people to destroy them for their very creation was abomination *end* This
touches on the issues raised in another article in this newsletter *end*
The Illuminati of Europe via the Br *end* East India Co *end* wrested control from the Great Moguls of the
Opium trade during the  and  century *end* People connected the Br *end* East India Co *end* were
responsible for the creation of the Fabian Society *end* The Illuminati already headquartered in London in
the  century allowed John Jacob Astor see Jan *end*  ‘ newsletter about the Astor family
beginning around  to operate an opium smuggling operation *end* Besides Astor’s ships picking up
quicksilver and lend at Gibraltar and iron/steel from northern Europe his ships picked up opium at
Smyrna Turkey *end* The opium was then sold in China *end* The Onassis family was one of the top three
merchant families in Smyrna *end* And Socrates Onassis until  quietly ran a banking operation or
money laundering *end* from their home which had a large amount of money left by powerful Turks *end* Could Socrates’ father been part of a secret Illuminati opium connection which had begun back about
 with the Astor family in Smyrna Turkey *end* We know for certain that he had powerful British
Italian and Turkish friends before he was arrested in  and that these friends saved his life from a
death sentence *end* About - his son Aristotle Onassis who was from Smyrna Turkey began
secretly importing opium into Argentina from Turkey under the cover and disguise of importing
tobacco *end* The Grand Orient of Italy by the Jewish Freemason Emannuele Carass established two secret
lodges at Salonika Turkey around the early  century *end* The dialect of the Jews in that area is often
mistakenly called ‘crude spanish." Actually the language is Latino a Judeo-Spanish dialect spoken in
Constantinople and Smyrna *end* A western Ladino is spoken in Salonika Bosnia and Serbia *end* Masonic
Jews speaking this Latino language were part of the Masonic plot that started World War I *end* Numerous
high level Masons were informed of the coming assassination of the Archduke which a thinking
person could realize what and contradiction *end* Actually I would state it slightly different *end* His life is
shrouded in smokescreens *end* However there are records documents witnesses etc *end* and it is possible to
reconstruct many details about his life *end* I will attempt to reconstruct some of the details of that life as
they pertain to his secret life as an Illuminati leader *end* The Illuminati is divided into the drug/porn
section the political/business management section and the cult ritual section global communications
section and mind-control section *end* The leadership within the various areas overlap *end* The
drug/porn/political areas work together as a unit *end* The mind-control area seems to be somewhat
technical and somewhat separate *end* Further several groups have been identified as assigned the job of
keeping the long range plans *end* The three groups that have been entrusted with long range plans are the
Order of the Garter Order of the Quest & Keepers of the Dawn *end* The plans to bring in the New World
Order are very detailed and their management and safekeeping have not been haphazard *end* Aristotle
worked within the drug/porn/political/business management area Aristotle’s power was so pervasive
that some researchers of his activities concluded that he was absolutely the most powerful man on
earth *end* This is because they were not aware of the shared power of the Illuminati "kings" *end* Aristotle did
have world-wide power but that appearance of power was there because he was part of Moriah the
Satanic hierarchy which controls the world *end* Aristotle Onassis’ family has bad their misfortunes too *end* All of the top families are in competition and although they work together they also fight together *end* Even within Aristotle’s own family a stiff long time rivalry with his brother-in-law made life difficult
for everyone assoclated with Aristotle *end* And yet for all their competition Aristotle invited Stavros
Niarchos to spend time on hIs yacht which Jacqueline his wife detested immensely *end*

ARISTOTLE LEAVES GREECE & GOES TO ARGENTINA

Aristotle’s father had planned to send him to Oxford but the Turkish genocide of the greek Turks
changed his plans *end* Aristotle instead set out from Greece to Argentina *end* Supposedly Aristotle landed in
Argentina stateless and broke *end* From what I can make out it appears to be true although it is possible

he had some contacts to help the move to a foreign country *end* It is said that he finally found a job as a
dishwasher in a bar on the corner of Corrientes & Talcahuano in Buenos Alres *end* Near the end of
he was able to obtain a job iater on with the British United River Plate Telephone Co *end* Argentina was
at times called the fifth British Dominion because the british Rothschilds and other british investors
owned so much of Argentina *end* In the next few years Aristotle proved himself a very capable manager
and with great potential as an underworld leader *end* Juan Gaoana the boss of a leading Argentine
cigarette manufacturing company was the first to put in an order through Aristotle to get tobacco from
Turkey via Ari’s father in Greece *end* This tobacco importing was the cover for Adi’s opium running *end* After two years Onassis went into manufacturing cigarettes *end* Again this was a cover but Onassis was
out to prove himself in anyway he could so he illegally borrowed the name of a famous Argentine
brand of cigarettes called BIS and labelled his cigarettes the same thing *end* The owner of BIS sued
Onassis for using his company’s name and won in court *end* The cigarette manufacturing was clearly a
losing deal and Onassis got out of it *end* However the biographies credit his cigarette manufacturing as
bringing in his wealth while at the same time acknowledging that he was losing money from them
and had to dump them because they were unprofitable *end* Which is it *end* As I stated Aristotle was running
drugs into Argentina *end* Aristotle states that he was penniless when he arrived in Argentina at age
and that he had made his first million dollars by age  *end* Long story short-the facts as to where he
lived what witnesses say etc *end* appear to collaborate that he went from having nothing to being
wealthy within those two years *end* His lifestyle changed dramatically *end* People blame his riches on the
fact that he worked long hours *end* I know many people who work long hours and are creative and
people just don’t move up the ladder that fast by working for a phone company and selling tobacco *end*
ARISTOTLE’S FRIENDS

Aristotle Onassis associated with many powerful people *end* The ract that he rubbed shoulders with
establishment figures that tie back to the elite is nothing surprising of a person his wealth *end* However it
is the nature of his involvement with other Illuminati figures that reveals his position within Moriah *end* Before going into his Illuminati business ventures let’s just discuss some of his friendships *end* An
example of his visits to friends is this quote from the book Onassis *end* ‘The Christina’s cruises always
produced items which no alert gossip columnist could miss *end* Onassis dropping in on Prince Alfonso
Hoheiohe’s Marbella Club in southern Spain and lunching with Baron and Baroness Guy de
Rothschild amidst rumors that it was Rothschild money that had supplanted his own in Monte Carlo
was obviously a noteworthy social incident.’ Onassis p *end*  During W.W *end* II Onassis was a regular
guest of the movie mogul Spyros Skouras at Mamaroneck on Long Island *end* Other close friends of
Onassis were the Perons of Argentina *end* The Perons set up a dictatorship in Argentina The Perons have
a great number of Nazi & Satanic connections/activities *end* If you get Into studying about the Perons
you will come up with names such as Josef Mengele a Satanic Nazi Doctor Dr *end* Fritz Thyssen and
Otto Skorzeny *end* Onassis had sexual liaisons with Evita Peron who was a platinum blonde *end* Onassis
had Nazi connections that continued his whole life as did the Perons *end* For instance one of Onassis’s
Nazi associates was Hjalmar Schacht president of Hitler’s Reichbank who Onassis hired after the
war *end* Schacht heiped Onassis’ shipyards in Germany build tankers after W.W *end* II *end* Until people realize
that the real guiding hand behind the Nazi’s was Satanism they will continue to be misguided as to
the way everything connects together at the top *end* For instance John Foster Dulles was the man at
Versailles Treaty who can be credited for having created the Treaty’s harsh terms against Germany
that ruined Germany financially after W.W *end* II *end* And yet this same man John Foster Dulles was the
person who secretly went to Hitler to confirm to Hitler that the elite would financially back Hitler’s
rise to power *end* If Hitler were anything like our image of him Hider would have rung his neck here
before him was the man who made Germany suffer..why was Hitler friendly with this man *end* It makes
no sense unless people wake up to what is going on *end* The answer is that there is a conspiracy of those
who are at the top to rule us and to guide us toward a New World Order and they are quite willing to
sacrifice whole nations to do that *end* Onassis was an extremely close friend of Winston Churchill *end* The
Freemason Winston Churchill is a descendent of a family that has been part of the elite that have
secretly run the world *end* Winston Churchill on several occasions told Onassis that the only one he could
trust in W.W *end* II was Joseph Stalin *end* This is a far cry from the picture given in history books *end* Winston
Churchill spent a great deal of time on Onassis’s yacht Christina *end* Onassis was also friendly with

Winston Churchill’s friend of Bernard Baruch *end* It was Bernard Baruch who convinced Winston
Churchill to join the Illuminati conspiracy *end* He asked Churchill to come watch something important in
NY in  and then he showed Churchill how they could destroy the Stock Market *end* That show of
power brought Churchill on board *end* Two other Illuminati friends of Ari Onassis were Joseph Kennedy
and Peter Grace both men also belonged to top  Illuminati bloodlines *end* Gianni Agnelli a powerful
man in the Illuminati spent time on a number of occasions on Onassis’s yacht Christina while it was
in the Riviera *end* Years before JFK became president Onassis had JFK and Winston Churchill on his
yacht at the same time *end* In  the Illuminati men who controlled the major oil companies got
together at Achnacarry Castle and formally created the Achnacarry Agreement which divided up the
worid into an international cartel *end* This is why you may have watched the same gas truck bring gas to
all the different gas stations in an area for instance say a Sinclair station a BP station Rothschilds
and an Exxon station Rockefeller *end* If the reader understands the world’s oil was totally in an
Illuminati monopoly by  it will help you understand that Aristotle who was the man who built
the largest oil tanker ships was also Illuminati *end* In one year alone during the s Onassis bought
new tankers *end*
EVIDENCE OF THE CONSPIRACY

One of the most telling papertrail signs that the conspiracy has left behind was an executive order that
FDR signed just after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor *end* This executive order was a semi-secret amendment
to Trading With The Enemy Act which made it LEGAL to trade with the enemy if the Sec *end* of the
Treasury then Hans Morganthau gave permission *end* Morganthau was a tool of the conspiracy and of
course he gave permission to the top Illuminati to trade with the enemy *end* In  a book came out
Trading With The Enemy which exposes how the elite secretly kept Hitler going by supplying him
rebuilding his communications etc *end* Onassis as an Illuminati king worked with other elites
Rockefeller Kennedy Getty to quietly make a profit and keep the war going longer *end* Onassis sold oil
and guns to both sides *end* ITT telephones were used in German submarines *end* This Executive Order
shows that at the top their is a conspiracy--it is reproduced on the following pages *end* There were
merchant ships owned by Greeks before W.W *end* II *end* Out of those Aristotle said  were sunk during
the war *end* The offIcial count was  *end* Either way it is clear that most of the Greek shippers lost their
large merchant ships *end* However the German submarines and aircraft never once touched Aristotles’
ships although they sailed through war zones *end* Neither did the Aliles *end* Aristotle alone did not suffer any
losses *end* Aristotle’s large fleet did not lose a single ship even the ones that were in Scandinavia when
the Germans invaded *end* Only the full colloboration at the highest levels could have pulled that one off *end*
HOWARD HUGHS

Howard Hughs was a self-made millionaire and genius *end* Howard Hughs was not part of the system so
he was fair game to destroy *end* Even millionaires like Hughs and the Hunt brothers have to toe the line
or they can be taken out by the Illuminati *end* This doesn’t mean Howard Hughs was virtuous *end* Howard
Hughs gave Nixon’s brother Donald a quarter million dollar "loan" gift in  in order to continue
having vice-pres *end* Nixon in his pocket *end* Hughs had been a supporter of Nixon for many years *end*
Onassis infiltrated his own men into Hugh’s organization *end* Chester Davis was from Sicily and
although he worked for Hughs took orders from Onassis *end* In  Hughs had obtained two doubles
one named L *end* Wayne Rector and the other Brooks Randie *end* In March  Onassis’ men at the
Beverly Hills Hotel captured Howard Hughs using Hughs’ own disloyal men *end* Hughs was seriously
hurt in the kidnapping *end* I believe at this point he was taken to Emerald Isle Hotel in the Bahamas *end* Some of the people who are aware that Onassis captured Hughs dispute that Hughs was taken out of
the country *end* The top floor was rented for the "Hughes Party" *end* For a month the captive Hughs was
shot full of heroin and then secretly transported to a cell on Onassis’ private island of Skorpios *end* Hughs two doubles stayed on under the pay of Onassis *end* One became Hughs and the other became
Hughs’ double *end* Computer programs which can duplicate signatures were used to provide Hugh’s
signature *end* The computer and its program used for duplicating Hughs’ signature even became public
knowledge when the Los Angeles TImes had an article on // about a computer which had been
programmed to write the signature of Hughes *end* The Mormon Mafia that supposedly guarded Hughs

actually ran the Hughs empire for Illuminatus Onassis which accounts for the change in policies that
were made by Hughs empire *end* It also explains why they bought up every newsreel they could find on
Hughes in order to duplicate voice-prints using computers *end* When they were through with the double
L *end* Wayne Rector he was shot at Rothschild’s Inn on the Park in London *end*
In a meeting with feilow Satanist Joseph Kennedy in September  the decision was taken to use
the Mafia’s power to get John F *end* Kennedy elected *end* The Mafia was caught in Chicago tampering big
time with the voting--but Nixon was denied a recount of the votes *end* Nixon backed off from making a
fuss because he was promised the chance to be President later *end* Illinois Republicans made an
unofficial recount of  paper ballot precincts in Cook County and came up with the vote in favor of
Nixon *end* Those votes would have changed Illinois’s electorial votes and thrown the victory to Nixon *end* However Sam Giancana and his henchman Mayor Richard Daley were not about to let an official
recount take place *end* In  Joseph Kennedy had a stroke and John Kennedy and Robert feeling their
freedom and disliking some of the powerful Illuminati like Aristotle Onassis decided to use their
popularity to destroy the conspiracy *end* I believe Kennedy and Robert had more courage to take on the
conspiracy due to the fact that they were familiar with it from having been in a sense on the inside
of it during their days growing up *end* However neither son had received the Illuminati training and
indoctrination that their older brother had and when be died *end* Joseph made a mistake when he decided
to replace Joe Jr *end* with John who they called Jack *end* The mistake was that John F *end* Kennedy may have
seemed like he’d be a good Illuminati President but he actually thought for himself *end* He thought for
himself because he was young and with that impetuousness and vigor of youth and with the
popularity he had he had the possibility to do some good for this nation *end* If I were state my
evaluation it would be to tell conservatives that they have been "hoodwinked" *end* John F *end* Kennedy did
more conservative preserving this nation things in his Presidency than Nixon and Reagan who are
heralded as conservative *end* Kennedy didn’t recognize Red China no-- that was Nixon *end* Kennedy didn’t
triple the national debt no that was Reagan *end* The CIA has been out to get JFK ever since they
realized JFK didn’t view himself as their puppet but that he viewed himself as their boss *end* The head of
the CIA on purpose ruined the CIA’s chances to succeed at the Bay of Pigs *end* He personally prevented
the CIA air cover from taking off which the CIA knew that without air support the operation had no
chance which was soon proved correct *end* in everyone’s zeal to get JFK they blamed JFK *end* It all
sounded so believable because the CIA were going to tell the full story *end* The public is not astute
enough to realize that the press had subtly turned against Kennedy *end* Two powerful friends who liked
John F *end* Kennedy and wanted to help JFK fight the elite were taken out before Kennedy was
assassinated *end* Senator Estes Kefauver whose Crime Commission had discovered the  deal that
Onassis Kennedy Meyer Roosevelt Lansky and other Illuminati--Mafia figures had made *end* Kefauver
was poisoned so that he had a secret poison induced "heart attack" on Aug *end*   *end* One suspect that
might have done it was his subordinate Bernard Fensterwald who was also a CIA assassin *end* The other
was Phillip Graham *end* His wife Katherine MEYER Graham has been a full participant of the
conspiracy and shows up repeatedly in elite activities *end* Katherine bribed some psychiatrists to certify
her husband who was editor of the Washington Post was insane *end* He was ordered by a judge into a
mental hospital *end* When he was allowed to visit home on a weekend he was found "suicided" by a
shotgun *end* Bobby Kennedy had a good idea who shot his brother *end* He wrote an unpublished book called
The Enemy Within and then later he was assassinated too *end* Actually the whole establishment were
out to get Kennedy and even George Bush was involved with the assassination *end*
The key to understanding the Illuminati is that it is headquartered in the London area *end* The Satanists
and witches refer to Great Brittain as the mother country Onassis had the best connections anyone
could want in the British Government as would be expected of someone of his standing in the
illuminati *end* He had many British friends just one example is Sir Lionel Heald the Br *end* Attorney
General *end* He attended the exclusive Br *end* Other Club *end* When W.W *end* II broke out on Sept *end*  ’ Onassis
was living in Savoy Hotel where the headquarters for the Illuminati’s Pilgrim Society are *end* The British
London Times backed Onassis in his dispute with Peru over whaling *end* Onassis did finally get himself
into trouble with illegal whaling when the nation of Norway gathered the evidence of his lulling of
hundreds of whales that were illegal to hunt *end* Just two more quick examples of his social connections
in Brittain are his attendence at J.Paul Getty’s party at Sutton Place Eng *end* in the ‘s and Onassis’

own big party for the elite on  June ’ at Dorchester England *end* As explained in Be Wise As
Serpents Britain’s overseas intelligence MI- is the Illuminati’s chief intelligence agency *end*
There is no way of knowing how many meetings took piace dealing with the planning of the
assassination of Kennedy *end* The first were high level Illuminati meetings *end* But the Illuminati meetings
were not operational level meetings *end* There were several levels of meetings *end* Next a series of meetings
by British Intelligence at Tryall Compound at Montego Bay Jamaica and Mafia meetings at who
knows where *end* A minor trading company called Permindex was the cover to an assassination bureau
that had its major U.S *end* subsidiary the International Trade Mart in New Orleans *end* The FBI’s Divison
was tied in with Permindex and Permindex’s board of directors had U.N *end* posts Mafia positions
European banking ties Nazi ties etc *end* In other words Permindex was well connected *end* By the time the
planning was done it included certain elements of the CIA and Freemasons *end* A Major Lauis Mortimer
Bloomfield Permindex’s Pres *end* & Chairman a key player in Hoover’s Division  and a member of
the Order of St *end* John of Jerusalem the Protestant branch of the Knights of Malta was a homosexual
lover of FBI director J *end* Edgar Hoover *end* All the board of Permindex and many of its various
subsidiaries were in various areas in November  carrying out the assassination and coverup *end* One
of the covers for the Permindex operators/teams was to pose as missionaries of the American Council
of Christian Churches ACCC *end* The whole reason the elite set up the extensive ACCC was to have a
cover for their killing units *end* For instance a group of about  of the best marksmen were undercover
as part of ACCC missionary school in Puebla Mexico The Tolstoy Foundation who I have visited
with were another pseudo "Christian" front *end* Later the headquarters of this assassination group was
shifted to Paradise Island Grand Bahamas to Intertel *end* Ian Flemming’s novels write about a Third
Force used to create a world government that was based in the resort islands of the Carribean *end* How
true that has become *end* In the Westerns put out by Hollywood when the bad guy does something to the
good guy he runs off with his woman *end* That is what happened with JFK *end* Onassis was one of the
Illuminati kings who decided JFK must go and he got to run off with the dead man’s wife *end* Onassis
had already gotten Jackie onto his yacht sexually prior to Kennedy’s assassination *end* Franklin
Roosevelt Jr *end* was on board together with Aristotie and Jackie *end* Jackie didn’t enjoy her marriage to
Onassis *end* At one point in their marriage when they were swimming nude at Onassis’ island Skorpios
ten photographers with underwater cameras and telephoto lens captured Jackie naked and her picture
was splashed across Playmen and Hustler etc *end* Jackie was furious and wanted her husband to sue the
newspapers and magazines which he refused to do A year before Aristotle died he actually admitted
that he had planned the whole operation *end* The date given for the actual Howard Hugh’s death who
had been kept prisoner under horrendous conditions by Onassis was Apr *end*   *end* In the previous
year  Hugh’s purported autobiography had come out written by Clifford Irving *end* Clifford Irving’s
wife took the publisher’s check made out to Howard Hugh’s to one of Onassis’s Swiss banks and
was paid *end*
FAMILY DIFFICULTIES

Onassis’ second wife was Tina Athina Mary Onassis when she divorced her husband for
committing adultery said "It is almost thirteen years since Mr *end* Onassis and I were married in New
York CIty *end* Since then he has become one of the world’s richest men but his wealth has not brought
me happiness with him nor as the world knows has it brought him happiness with me."

Tina divorced Ari and then went on to soon marry a relative of Winston Churchill the Marquess of
Blandford *end* Later she divorced him and married her old brother-in-law Stavros Niarchos in May
 *end* But after he killed her sister she quit him too *end*
EUGENIA KILLED

Eugenic the sister-in-law of Ari Onassis died according to the official version of an overdose of
sleeping pills *end* Her body in the post-mortem was covered with bruises black left eye swelling on the
left temple *end* a hemorrhage to the left of the larynx and so forth down the rest of her body *end* Let’s not *end* swallow the Illuminati’s propaganda to lull us into sleep about what they have done *end*
It might also be important to comment on the background of the Uvanos family *end* Both Stavros
Niarchos and Aristotle Onassis married Uvanos girls *end*
The Uvanos family was a prominent family on the Turkish island of Chios *end* The island of Chios had a
type of tree mastic trees that produced an early form of chewing gum *end* From the word mastic is where
we get the word masticate *end* Chios was the privnte property of the sultan and it was where he kept his
harem *end* The island was given special royal treatment and allowed to have it full of chewing gum and
"booze and broads" *end* The Uvanos family was one of the leading families on this island *end*

Bloodlines of Illuminati

By

Fritz Springmeier

The Rockefeller Bloodline

One of the  Satanic bloodlines that rule the world is the Rockefeller bloodline *end* Today there are
around  members of this family with the Rockefeller name and of course some others by other last
names *end* This article is to explore further for those who investigate the Illuminati how the Rockefeller
bloodline is involved in the promotion of the occult and Satanism and how they are involved in the
control of the Christian denominations *end* This article keys in on just one family the Rockefellers *end* To
understand the full extent of the Illuminati’s control of religion including Christendom would
require perhaps several books *end* The Illuminati itself draws its lifeblood from around  very
powerful families worldwide *end* This article will not attempt to explain their networks and the many
organizations of the Illuminati *end* It will not even try to do this for the Rockefellers *end* In fact no one
knows how many trusts and foundations the Rockefellers have *end* They have hidden trusts within secret
trusts within secret trusts *end* It is estimated that they have between  and several thousand trusts and
foundations *end* The finances of the Rockefellers are so well covered that Nelson Rockefeller did not pay
one cent in income taxes in  yet he was perhaps the richest man in the U.S *end* The Rockefellers
exert enormous influence over religion in this nation in the following ways

 *end* They provide a large share of the money that Seminaries in the United
    States need to operate *end*  *end* They provide a large share of the money that universities need to operate *end* Education influences the
religious values of our people *end*  *end* They provide large grants to various religious organizations *end*  *end* Their influence and control helps determine who will get publicity in the major news magazines
and on television *end*  *end* Their influence has contributed to various anti-Christian organizations being set up *end*  *end* They directly help control certain religious groups such as Lucis Trust *end*
The Rockefeller’s influence is both subtle and not so subtle *end*
In the book The Unholy Alliance details are given on how the seminaries church boards and
Christian colleges have been captured *end* Much of the money for this came from the Rockefellers *end* One
of the principle large Foundations that was instrumental in controlling religious institutions of various
kinds was the Sealantic Fund *end* They have now shifted to other channels *end* This Foundation which was
incorporated in  and was headquartered in New York City  West  St *end* gave enormous
sums of money to manipulate Protestant concerns *end* In  according to the Russell Sage
Foundation’s book The Foundation Directoy the Sealantic Fund gave away   in grants *end* In  the Fund gave  in grants *end* By  the Sealantic Fund was not being used *end* But a look at anotherRockefeller non-profit untaxed
Foundation the Rockefeller Brother’s Fund shows a revealing grant pattern *end* Many people would not
be able make any sense out of what seems a random pattern of grants without the broad picture of
what the Illuminati is doing today *end* My book Be Wise As Serpents should have clarified how those



various groups who receive grants are related and helpful to the Rockefeller agenda *end* Although these
other Rockefeller Foundations are not specifically geared toward religion such as the Sealantic Fund
was it is clear these other Foundations still impact religion *end*

The Union Theological Seminary has operated from Rockefeller funds *end* UTS hasn’t been the
only Protestant Seminary receiving Rockefeller funds but it may be the best example of a seminary
controlled by the Rockefellers.The Sealantic Fund stated under its purpose and activities “Current
interests are primarily Protestant theological education..... *end*
The President of the Sealantic Fund when it operated was David Rockefeller and Laurance not
Lawrence S *end* Rockefeller was Vice-President *end* Steven C *end* Rockefeller was one of the trustees *end*
 *end* They provide a large share of the money that universities need to operate *end* Education
influences the religious values of our people *end*
In  Congressman Eugene E *end* Cox headed up a committee that for the first time tried to uncover
the Rockefeller’s and other’s foundations’ activities *end* For some reason Cox encountered stiff
opposition everywhere against his committee’s investigation and the Congressman for some reason
got sick and died *end* One member of the committee Congressman Carroll Reese and his Counsel Rene
Wormser attempted to continue the investigation *end* Rockefeller’s henchmen and newspapers did their
best to destroy Congressman Reese *end* The Reese investigation was given only the barest minimum of
time and little resources for their investigation *end* However they were still able to uncover that
beginning in the s vast sums of money were spent in Education by the Rockefeller and Carnegie
foundations *end* This money went to promote John Dewey Marxism a One-World-Government agenda
and Socialism *end* The foundations principally the Rockefeller and Carnegie stimulated two-thirds of
the total endowment funding of all institutions of higher learning in America during the first third of
this  century *end*


The NEA National Education Association was largely financed by the Rockefeller/Carnegie
foundations *end* A  NEA report advised “A dying laissez-faire must be completely destroyed and all
of us including the ‘owners’ must be subjected to a large degree of social control.” Reece Committee
Counsel Rene Wormser wrote of the investigation “...leads one to the conclusion that there was
indeed something in the nature of an actual conspiracy among certain leading educators in the United
States to bring about socialism through the use of our school systems...” They discovered that the
Rockefeller foundation was the primary culprit behind the teaching of socialism in America’s schools
and universities and also behind the NEA’s policies *end* Rene Wormser Counsel for the Reece
Committee reported “A very powerful complex of foundations and allied organizations has
developed over the years to exercise a high degree of control over education *end* Part of this complex
and ultimately responsible for it are the Rockefeller and Carnegie groups of foundations.” This was
the situation in the s when the Reece Committee briefly investigated *end* The Rockefeller-Carnegie
groups have continued basically unopposed for the next  years in controlling education *end* One of the
educational book producers is Grolier Inc *end* Avery Rockefeller Jr *end* sits on Grolier Inc *end* board meetings *end* Another interesting board member is Theodore WaIler who is the director of Grolier Inc *end* He was a
member of the International Book Committee of UNESCO *end* The Rockefellers maintain great
influence in the United Nations *end*
 *end* They provide large grants to various religious organizations *end*
On Jan *end*   John D *end* Rockefeller addressed the Protestant Council of the City of N.Y *end* and told
them that the answer to the problems Christianity was that Christianity needed to become “the Church
of the Living God.” Many listening that day may not have realized that he and other top Illuminati
consider themselves gods and that the solution John D *end* was cryptically giving was for Christianity to
serve him a living god *end* Rockefeller John D *end* The Christian Church- What of its Future *end* NY
Protestant Council  &  *end*
 *end* Their influence and control helps determine who will get publicity in the major news
magazines *end*
The Rockefeller family has enormous controls over various magazines and newspapers *end* Let us
examine how the power of the press can be used in religion *end* One of the magazines that the
Rockefellers have some control over is Time magazine *end* Time’s board chairman Andrew Heiskell
was associated with David Rockefeller *end* Another Illuminatus of the  level Henry J *end* Fisher ran
McCall’s Magazine from  to  *end* The establishment’s media boosted Anton LaVey’s Church
of Satan into prominence *end* The Jan *end*   New York Daily News ran a story about Anton LaVey
performing the first Satanic wedding ceremony in America *end* The March  issue of McCall’s ran a
nice story about the Church of Satan *end* Not only is LaVey’s Church of Satan a publicity stunt to make
Satanism more popular and to deflect criticism of real covert Satanism the McCall issue makes
Anton LaVey’s church sound even better in the article than it is *end* For those brainwashed folks who
think that this free advertising for Anton LaVey was just for the sake of finding a good story for the
Daily News and McCall I can show you dozens of better juicier stories that never have seen the light
of day--because they are contrary to what the Illuminati want people to hear *end* I won’t argue that a
story on Satanism may be interesting I am pointing out that many other interesting stories don’t get
printed *end* Stories are selected by an editor they don’t just happen *end* Finally on June   Time
Magazine provided more coverage for LaVey with an article “The Occult A Substitute Faith.”
Believe me the sincere devout Christian groups haven’t ever received such nice free publicity *end* I’m
not referring to men like ° Mason Billy Graham who works for the New World Order and Knights
Templar Mason Charles T *end* Russell founder of the Watchtower Society who both received great press
coverage *end* Another minor example and I am pointing out minor examples because they occur many
times during the course of year is Van Daniken’s UFO books *end* Lew Wasserman head of MCA which
owns G.P *end* Putnam’s Sons is a member of the Rockefeller University Council *end* G.P *end* Putnam’s Sons
published Van Daniken’s anti-Christian UFO religious theories *end* Cadence Industries own Marvel
Comics *end* The men on the board of Cadence sit under David Rockefeller in places like the CFR *end* Is it
any wonder Marvel Comics promotes the occult and heros like ‘The Son of Satan” *end* Where does the



buck stop *end* You say that the Rockefellers don’t control subordinates *end* Bear in mind that many of the
Rockefellers call themselves Baptists *end* If they are really Christians don’t you think they could use their
influence to stop such terrible things *end* The point is that the rottenness starts at the top *end* The rest of the
pyramid has a hard time turning out O.K *end* when the top of the pyramid is dedicated to Satan *end* Rockefeller and Hearst worked together in their news monopolies *end* It was Hearst who promoted both
books on Satanism and Billy Graham *end* If you learn what I know--the two are not contradictory *end* Hearst made Billy Graham who he is today by financially backing him and publicizing him *end* Rockefeller was supportive of Billy Graham’s New York Crusade and the Manhattan-Chase Bank
helped Billy Graham out *end*
 *end* Their influence has contributed to various anti-Christian organizations being set up *end*
Maurice Strong is a good friend of the Rockefellers *end* He has been promoting Mother Gaia worship *end* David Rockefeller works with Maurice Strong and his New Age ideas *end* Reverend Moon from Korea
has been very much loved by the Rockefellers *end* Moon calls himself Christ and is setting up a religion
promoting internationalism *end* His religion is also a good testing ground for brainwashing/recruiting
techniques that are being perfected by the NWO *end* The Rockefellers have been helping Moon who also
has his primary mansion in NY *end* Also of interest is that the prominent political figures that have
endorsed Moon are those with ties to the NWO and include Ted Kennedy Mason Mark C *end* Hatfield
Mason Jesse Helms & Illuminatus William F *end* Buckley Jr *end* See pg *end* - of The Puppet Master by J *end* Isamu Yamamoto *end* A lesser known group is the Spiritual Frontiers Fellowship SFF in
Independence MO *end* Their address was Exec *end* Plaza  Winner Rd  *end* They were founded in
 *end* Just like Reverend Moon they claim to be Christians but teach and practice other things *end* They
teach and practice the occult *end* Two prominent men in SFF are Marcus
Bach and Gardner Murphy *end* They both have interesting backgrounds *end* Marcus Bach shows the touch of
the Rockefellers *end* Marcus Bach born in  is director
of special projects for SFF *end* The Rockefeller Foundation granted him a fellowship in “research and
creative writing” from - *end* Gardner Murphy was the consultant in
 for UNESCO in New Delhi to the Hindus of the Indian Ministry of Education *end* From ‘-’ he
was director of research at the Menninger Foundation Topeka KS *end* Yes psychology is led mainly by
occultists *end* Menninger himself is a member of several environmental groups for the elite an
Honorary trustee of the Aspen Institute a Freemason member of ACLU and a close associate of W *end* Clement Stone *end* W *end* Clement Stone in turn is also a Mason a member of the occult American Society
for Psychical Research and the financial backer of the Menninger Foundation *end* The Federal Council
of Churches was financed to a large extent by Rockefeller money *end* In my Be Wise As Serpents book I
detail how the FCC was designed to destroy Christianity how they carefully plotted to make the
creation of the FCC look like a grass roots movement when it was actually the creation of the elite
Illuminati *end* I further detail how the men who ran it were high ranking Masons Socialists and One-
Worlders *end* Also shown is how they carefully manipulated the real gospel for their own devious ends *end*
 *end* They directly help control certain religious groups such as Lucis Trust *end*
David Rockefeller is part of Lucis Trust’s management *end* Lucis Trust puts out the book Externalization
of the Hierarchy by Alice Bailey which spells out The Plan for the Satanists and New Agers on how
the spiritual Hierarchy actually the demonic hierarchy is to externalize their rule of the planet *end* The
book gives quite a few of the details of the plan and is used as a textbook for New Agers at the
Arcane Schools in NY London and Europe on how the New Age/One World Religion/One-World-
Government will be brought in *end* If anyone doubts the Rockefeller’s commitment to Satan read page
 of Externalization of the Hierarchy *end* On page  Alice Bailey President of the Theosophical
Society and part of Lucis formerly Lucifer Trust tells us who will rule when the New Age New
World Order takes over *end* On the Earthly level--Humanity so to speak the Ruler is given on page
as Lucifer *end* On the Spiritual level--called “Shamballa - the Holy City” the coming ruler is given as
“the Lord of the World” which we Christians know as Satan *end* Lucis Trust knows it is Satan too but
for public consumption they say that the “ruler of the world” is Sanat a scrambling of Satan
Kumara *end* They also predict there will be a Christ Consciousness and the Christ actually the Anti-



Christ The book Externalization of the Hierarchy teaches repeatedly see pages -  that
the  vehicles to bring in the New Age will be the Masonic Lodges obviously not everyone attends
Lodges next the Churches this is clearly revealing to us that men like the Rockefellers are using the
churches for the Luciferian plan of Lucis Trust and finally Education Well of course education *end* Not everyone attends churches *end* They need a safety net to catch everyone in their brainwashing to
make us all want to be happy slaves under the Light-bearer *end* The home life of the Rockefellers is
decidedly different than for most people *end* They have over  homes to stay at *end* The Rockefellers own
vast tracts of good land in various countries in South America and have nice homes in Brazil
Ecuador and their Monte Sacro Ranch Venezuela *end* They have two mansions in Washington D.C *end* at
least numerous ranches around the United States resorts in Hawaii Puerto Rico and the Caribbean
a - room  Ave duplex in N.Y *end* not to mention their place at Seal Harbor Maine and the large
estate at Pocantico Hills NY *end* It is estimated that they have  house servants *end* Over the years they
have built up the reputation of being miserly with their help and to each other *end* I couldn’t begin to
know all about the Rockefellers but I can give a sampling of some of the many items that surround
the real lives of America’s top Illuminati family *end* Winthrop who is homosexual enjoyed living in
Arkansas with his black male friend *end* He reportedly had the world’s largest porn collection *end* Winifred
Rockefeller Emeny Nelson’s cousin murdered her two children and committed suicide *end* Michael Rockefeller died when he tried to bribe New Guinea tribesmen with large sums of money to

Interviews--with ex-Illuminati Manuscript--from ex-high ranking Mason who strangely died it was
called a suicide soon after completing his expose of the New World Order’s elite *end*
WHY AM I COVERING THE TOP  ILLUMINATI BLOODLINES *end* I have often been asked who are the liluminati *end* Who are the people at the top of the conspiracy *end* Who
are the generational satanic families *end* The illuminati consists of  magical and powerful bloodlines *end* There are also some other powerful bloodlines that are worth naming but if they are in the Illuminati
they have blood ties to one of the  powerful lineages *end* About half of the Illuminati people I know
have had their parentage hidden from them *end* Many of the those who still know who their real parents
are still do not know what bloodline they belong to until the liluminati chooses to reveal it to them *end* Most of the Illiuminati have MPD *end* When high level Satanists do not have MPD they very often
emotionally break under the stress of the horrible blood rituals that are requIred *end* Recently a non-
MPD Satanist in Chicago emotionally broke and gave his life to Christ *end* I have videos available of an
interview of this man exposing Satanism *end* One of the important lineages has remained secret untill
investigators named Lincoln Leigh and Bageant were spoon-fed leads and secrets *end* They put this into
a book called "Holy Blood Holy Grail." I recommend the book and the two books which are its
sequels because they show how just one part of the  lineages has kept itself secret and has taken
immense power of all forms to themselves *end* In Southern Belgium there is a castle *end* If any one is
travelling there and wants to find the castle I will show them on the map and describe it *end* This is the
Mothers of Darkness castle *end* In that castle is a cathedral and in that cathedral’s basement a little baby
Is sacrificed daily and Is coming to power *end* The pages are written almost round the clock *end* This castle
is also described in my Be Wise as Serpents book *end* The history in that handwritten book would reveal
the real facts behind the propaganda that the world’s major news medias give the gullible public *end* The
history as that book reveals it would tell people about how Abraham Lincoln was a descendent of the
Rothschilds *end* Abraham Uncoin was the secret head of the Rosicrucians a member of their  headed
top counci *end* I have seen the paper trail proof to these things about Lincoln to my satisfaction that
these things about Uncoin are true *end* Adolf Hitler was also a secret member of the Rothschild lineage *end* Hitler carried out blood sacrifices to open his mind up to high level demonic spiritual control *end* Rockefeller sold Hitler oil during W.W *end* II via Spain to keep W.W *end* II going longer *end* The history in that
book mentions people that the “history books” given the public don’t-- like Michael Augustus
Martinelli Von Braun Rheinhold the most powerful Satanist in the world a few years ago *end* Michael
Augustus Martinelli Von Braun Rheinhold had  Satanic Brides *end* And that Satanic book in the
Mothers of Darkness castle also mentions the Rockefeller bloodline *end* Only insiders are supposed to
know the real history of what has taken place in human history *end* The real decisions and the real
movers and shakers have been hidden from the public’s eyes *end* What the public is given is a stage show
where illuminati puppets parade around and make big speeches according to their script *end* Each of the
 families has their own set of Mothers of Darkness *end* Each of the  families has their own secret
Satanic leadershipKings Queens Princesses and Princes of Darkness *end* For instance the Rockefeller
family has people who are selected as Kings and Princes within their own bloodline in secret rituals *end* The Kings and Princes Queens and Princesses are strictly bloodline *end* They secretly rule over an area
of the world for their own bloodline *end* This is independent of the liluminati’s hierarchy which was
diagrammed in the Jan  newsletter *end* my Newsletter from a Christian Ministry *end* In the January
 issue the Covens Sisters of Light Mothers of Darkness and the Grande Mothers were
diagrammed *end* The illuminati pulls its various bloodlines together under several councils *end* The Grande
Druid Council or your Council of  is your principle council for the Brotherhood of Death *end* Above
the Council of  is a higher Council of  and an inner group of  is believed to head that Council of
Nine *end* How do we know about these things *end* The power of God has reached into the very heart of
Satan’s emplre and pulled out some of the most powerful Satanists and drawn them to Christ *end* There
are several Satanists that were at the top which have managed to find Christ *end* in addition some of the
next echelon of the hierarchy such as some of the Mothers of Darkness are also finding Christ *end* if
someone wants to understand how and why decisions are made in world affairs and by who-- then
you need to study the illuminati *end* The real answers do not rest with the proceedings of the Congress of



the United States or with the publicly known leaders of the Communist countries *end* An example of
what I am talking there is a book entitled "Who Financed Hitler" by James Pool and Suzanne Pool *end* I
am always glad to see that some people are wiling to look behind the scenes *end* Believe me there were
people that Hitler listened to *end* They were the people he went to ritual with and who put him into
power *end*
A CONTINUATION OF THE SERIES OF ARTICLES ON ThE TOP  ILLUMINATI
BLOODLINES *end* ThE ROCKEFELLER FAMILY

PREFACE *end* The first article about the House of Rockefeller in this newsletter occurred in the Mid-Dec  Vol *end* No *end*  Issue pp *end* - *end* The primary focus of that article was to show how the family controlled large
segments of the Protestant groups in the United States *end* A secondary focus of that article was to show
the Satanic occult side of the family *end* An attempt will be made in this article not to rehash information
given out in that earlier article *end* The Rockefeller family has been so busy and there Is a large amount
of information that can be provided about them *end* Therefore my goal with this article Li to provide
introductory information to the readership and to qualify that what is written In this article Is but the
basics of what should be written about the illuminati actIvities of this family *end* Much of my own
material on the Rockefeller family was lost this year and I don’t have the time to go back and research
it again *end* Much of it involved the secret wheeling and dealing that went on behind the scenes to bring
the Rockefellers into wealth and power *end* Some of the details also involved their manipulations to
control about everything that the Rockefellers can find to control *end* Some of the research was on the
occult activities of the House of Rockefeller *end*
THE FIRST NOTORIOUS ROCKEFELLER *end* The first notorious Rockefeller that researchers who are not working for the Rockefellers refer to is
William Avery Rockefeller  -? *end* William Avery Rockefeller was totally corrupt and lacked
any type of morals *end* He was involved in the occult and practiced magic *end* He married a number of
women around the country in bigamous relationships *end* He also had a number of mistresses and a large
number of sexual partners *end* He was charged with raping a women and escaped the state of New York
to prevent being sent to Jail for it *end* He stole lied and abused his way through life *end* He wore the best of
clothes and he never lacked for money including gold coins *end* Besides loving women he loved
gambling *end* And where did his money to gamble with come from *end* He made much of his money
dishonestly *end* His life Is a carbon copy of other men who are known by this author to have been in the
Illuminati *end* The reader also needs to bear in mind that the Illuminati carries out a large number of
secret occult marriages which only insiders learn about *end* One of his wives was Eliza Davidson
 *end* She was an extremely cruel woman *end* Historians who have been bought off by the elite like
to picture Eliza Davidson as a very pious woman *end* Although she had a religious front there are a
number of things in her life that show that she was not the paragon of virtue that the paid-for
historians have made her out to be *end* When she married William Avery Rockefeller she moved in with
him and his mistress *end*
THE FIRST NOTABLY RICH ROCKEFELLER *end* William Avery Rockefeller had many bastard children and it can be imagined many children born for
ritual or for the cult *end* His wife Eliza had six children for him and of those John Davison Rockefeller is
the infamous one who brought the family into limelight *end* John D *end* Rockefeller in his lifetime became
on of the most powerful men in the world *end* One of the most best kept secrets were his secret dealings
with the other Illuminati families *end* The Payseurs and other Illuminati families are all intimately
involved in the rise to power of the Rockefellers *end* The other factors involved in John D *end* Rockefeller’s
rise to power Is his utter ruthlessness *end* He was willing to do anything for power *end* John o *end* Rockefeller
established the family in their principal estate at Pocantico Hills in New York *end* I have lost the exact
figure but over  Rockefeller families live at the private land of Pocantico Hills *end*
A BRIEF SURVEY OF THE ROCKEFELLER’S INFLUENCE
The Rockefellers have divested much of their holdings into places which they control but nominally



they are not owners of *end* The Rockefellers financial power Is far greater than the balance sheets would
indicate *end* The Rockefellers can give donations from an organization which they control to another that
they control and not lose any control over the money *end* The donations look Impressive but the
Rockefeller bloodline hasn’t lost *end* Have you ever noticed that Rockefeller’s Standard Oil uses the
satanic pentagram in a circle as their logo *end* Just three of countless Rockefeller companies are Texas
Instruments and General Electric and Eastman Kodak *end* The Rockefellers also control Boeing *end* This
author Fritz Sprlngmeier has repeatedly been given information from numerous sources about the
occult activities that are being perpetrated at the Boeing plants in the Seattle area *end* Monarch
programming has even taken place at a Boeing Plant *end* All these things fit together when one gets the
bigger picture and the inside scoop *end* The Rockefellers also control Delta *end* Has anyone realized that the
Delta symbol is a very widely used satanic symbol *end* Is It any wonder so many Illuminati and CIA and
world financiers and people like Chuck Coison see the exposes on Chuck Colson in ’s

Florida and Seal Harbor Maine *end* Notice how often Bush would go to Maine when he was President *end* The Rockefellers have played a role in Lucis Trust and the United Nations *end* Interestingiy you will
notice that Prince Charles is the spokesperson for Lucis Trust and also works with the United Nations
in various ways *end* Prince Charles Is from another satanic bloodline *end* Readers need to study my Be Wise
As Serpents book to see how Lucis Trust fits into things *end* The Rockefellers were involved in the
creation of the FBI so that the FBI has always been an arm of power for the Illuminati *end* That is why
there are official FBI programs in action today to kIdnap children and provide them for sacrifice *end* Yes
American people the wolf was set in charge of guarding the chicken coop *end* The organization that is
working as part of the FBI is the Finders *end* The stink was so bad that US *end* News & World Report did a
story to soften the impact of the scandal *end* See the article on a following page *end* Ex-Satanists who
worked with the FBI to receive the children the FBI kidnapped and sold to them for sacrifice have
been trying to get the word out publicly about the FBI’s corruption *end* When the Illuminati was
beginning to get exposed in the Franklin Saving & Loan case in Lincoln NE the FBI was part of the
dirty actors and was part of the cover up *end* The Rockefellers have had control over the FBI since they
helped get it started *end* When Congress wanted to investigate the CIA for wrongdoing the appointed a
Commission headed by Rockefeller to investigate the CIA’s wrongdoings *end* Yes the Rockefeller
Commission did a big study and slapped the hands of the CIA for a few misdeeds *end* Their report is still
cited as the big investigation of the CIA *end* Some investigation *end* Since the Rockefeller family work hand
in hand with the CIA to create Monarch slaves of course that part of the CIA’s misdeeds got
overlooked *end* A recent convert from Satanism Michael McArthur has given validated inside information about the
FBI and the CIA programs which kidnap children in order to supply Satanic rituals with sacrificial
material *end* The names of the agents who spend their official government time kidnapping children for

working to bring in a public One-World government *end* The world already has a secret One-World-
Government *end* The Rockefellers take part in decisions that effect Russia China and other parts of Asla
and with good reason the House of Rockefeller has holdup and assets in these countries too *end* The investigator of the Rockefellers will find that they have secretly had their hand in the politics of



the United States during the  century *end* The decisions and directions this nation has taken are the
result of countless orders which the Rockefellers have given to their underlings *end*

Two neighbor horse farmers came together one day to talk business *end* The first farmer
sold his horse to the second for a quarter million dollars and then bought it back for
about  more *end* He could now advertise his horse actually worth  as a horse he
that he had paid over a quarter of a million dollars for *end*

for if there is one area in life that exceeds the religious in deception and touches all of us it is the
financial *end* What else can we do about it except laugh *end* The famous poet Lord Byron describes the

ROTHSCHILD TALKS ABOUT THEIR DYNASTY

Lord Rothschild in his book The Shadow of a Great Man quotes a letter sent from Davidson on June
  to Nathan Rothschild As long as a house is like yours and as long as you work together
with your brothers not a house in the world will be able to compete with you to cause you harm or to
take advantage of you for together you can undertake and perform more than any house in the
world." The closeness of the Rothschild brothers is seen in a letter from Saloman Salmon
Rothschild to his brother Nathan on Feb *end*   "We are like the mechanism of a watch each part
is essential *end*  This closeness is further seen in that of the  marriages made by Mayer Amschel
Rothschild’s grandchildren  were contracted between first cousins *end*
VISITING THE NATION THE ROTHSCHILDS BUILT

In  in the summer after the Yom Kippur War this Author toured Israel and got the chance to
personally visit many of the buildings like the Knesset that the Rothschild’s money has built *end* The

W.W *end* I *end* A few powerful Jews including the Rothschilds were responsible for the wording of the
Treaty imposed on Germany that ended W.W *end* I  The treaty gave the Rothschilds the German
owned railway rights in Palestine which had been part of the Turkish Ottoman Empire thus paving
the way for the Rothschilds to have a sure leverage to dictate policy concerning Palestine *end* The

the Turkish government collapsed after W.W *end* I because they were on the losing side the Rothschilds

THE ROTHSCHILDS AS "PROPHETS"

One item stands out as a person listens to the International Bankers and reads their books *end* They
believe money is what makes the world go round *end* If you have money you can do anything *end* Money is
"God" and it is worshipped and served *end* Even after these families accumulate more than can be spent
these devotees continue selling their souls for this false but powerful god *end* The great poet-philosopher
Heinrich Heine a Banker’s son said "Money is the god of our time and Rothschild is his prophet."
Following the cue of the Rothschilds Heinrich Heme a Jew signed his name by drawing a Seal of
Solomon *end* Amsel Rothschild is reported to have said "Give me control of the economics of a country;
and I care not who makes her laws *end*  Today his descendents meet twice daily in London to dictate
to the world what the world price of gold will be *end* They also dictate what the "Federal Reserve
System" will do with America’s finances *end*
ANOTHER GOD TOO

According to eye-witnesses who were prominent enough to visit one of the British Rothschild
homes the Rothschilds worship yet another god too Satan *end* They set a place for him at their table.a
The Rothschilds have been Satanists for many generations *end* The Rothschilds are an important part of
the history of the Seal of Solomon also known as hexagram Magen David six-pointed star Star of
David *end* The Seal of Solomon the hexagram was not considered a Jewish symbol before the
Rothschilds began using it *end* Throughout the Middle Ages the Seal of Solomon had been used by Arab
Magicians Cabalist Magicians Druid witches and Satanists *end* One of the few ancient uses of the
symbol was on the floor of a  year old Moslem Mosque found where Tel Aviv is today *end* In the
twelve century an Ashkenazic Jew Menahem ben Duji who thought he was the Messiah used the
magical symbol *end* Because the Rothschilds were Satanists they adopted this powerful magic symbol
in  for their coat- of-arms *end* The name they adopted for their family actually comes from the fact
that in the  century Mayer Amschel Bauer began hanging out a red hexagram in front of their
house to identify it *end* Mayer Amschel then decided to take the name red-schield Rothschild in
German after the red Seal of Solomon that they used *end* Alice Bailey in A Treatise On White Magic p *end*  claims that the Hierarchy has a special group which she calls "the financial group" controlling
all that can be converted into energy and constituting a dictatorship over all modes of intercourse
commerce and exchange." According the Luciferian Alice Bailey the "financial group" is the latest
group directed by the Hierarchy *end* In  Zevi Hirsch Kalischer approached Rothschild and proposed
Rothschild buy all of Erez Israel *end* It took many years for the Rothschilds to finally create Israel *end* The
Rothschilds have been a primary force behind the creation of Israel and so it is appropriate that the
nation carries their magical Seal of Solomon as the state logo *end* The Ultra-orthodox Jews in Israel will
not serve in the Israeli army because they know that Almighty God was not behind the creation of
modern Israel but rather the rich ungodly apostate Jews *end* They refuse to serve the ungodly *end* They are
more wiser than men like Jerry Falwell who run around proclaiming Israel is God’s nation *end* Men like
Falwell are the type that this Author finds reference to repeatedly in Jewish documents that speak of
their power within the Fundamentalists *end* God is ultimately in charge he has allowed Hitler to come to
power Stalin to come to power and the Rothschilds to come to power *end* In the same sense that God
rules over and blessed Stalin’s Russia he rules over America and Israel *end* To twist scriptures about
God seating the rulers and then to apply them to bless one Satanic secular communist nation and not
another is inconsistent and not correctly using the Word of Truth *end* Some people object that the
conspiracy of Power is labelled Jewish rather than Satanic by certain concerned citizens *end* This
objection is valid-- however will these objectors then take the obvious next step and admit the nation
of Israel which the Rothschild’s created is Satanic and not Jewish *end* But then who knows precisely
why people do what they do *end* If you ask someone why he does something he will give you one
answer today another tomorrow and another the next day *end* Does he do what he does for a real reason
or a single motive *end* Perhaps to label the Power as only Satanic or only Jewish or only Masonic is to
neglect the personal human dimension *end* This personal human dimension is godless *end* Being godless it
fills that void by pretending its men are gods *end* This brings us right back to the Gnostic religions and

Satan *end* Most Jewish people do not concern themselves with learning the occultic significance to their
treasured Magen David Star of David *end* King David did not have anything to do with the hexagram
although his son Solomon did when he began worshipping Ashtoreth star also known as Astarte
Chiun Kaiwan Remphan and Saturn *end* Solomon built altars to Star Astarte aka Ashtoreth *end* The
god Saturn is associated with the Star but both Saturn and Astarte also been identified with a number
of other names *end* Saturn is an important key to understanding the long heritage this conspiracy has back
to antiquity *end* The city of Rome was originally known as Saturnia or City of Saturn *end* The Roman
Catholic church retains much of the Saturn worship in its ritual *end* Saturn also relates to Lucifer.’ In
various occult dictionaries Saturn is associated with evil *end* Saturn was important to the religion of
Mithra and also the Druids *end*

government which will protect the poor from the ravenous and the wealthy *end* Banking institutions on
sound bases and doing business honorably are also greatly needed " Russell continues "May the
God of Jacob direct you my dear Sir and all interested with you in the deliverance and prosperity of
Israel and blessed will they be who to any extent yield themselves as his servants in fulfilling his
will as predicted." When the Mormon Church needed financing in the late  century they
went to Kuhn Loeb Co *end* To explain the Rothschild’s control of Kuhn Loeb Co *end* here is some
background information *end* The method that the House of Rothschild used to gain influence was the
same that Royalty had used for centuries marriage *end* The Rothschild children girls and boys have had
their spouses chosen on the basis of alliances that would benefit the House of Rothschild but since
consolidating world power they generally have married cousins these last two centuries.’ Jacob
Schiff grew up in the house that the Rothschild’s had at  Judengasse Frankfurt *end* Jacob Schiff came
to the United States with Rothschild capital and took over control of a small jewish banking concern
founded by two Cincinnati dry goods merchants Abraham Kuhn and Solomon Loeb *end* He even married
Soloman’s daughter *end* In  Loeb retired and Schiff ran the Kuhn Loeb Co *end* for the Rothschilds
until  when he died *end* During Russell’s and Brigham Young’s day Lord Rothschild was
considered the "lay leader of world Jewry." Edmund Rothschild was President of the Jewish
Colonization Assoc which was a major Zionist group *end* Amselm Rothschild indicated that his
grandfather Amschel Mayer Rothschild had insisted in Clause  of his will to his children "may
they and their descendants remain constantly true to their ancestral Jewish faith." However the
will has been secret and there is no way of knowing what it says *end* The Rothschilds have not remained
true to the Orthodox faith *end* If this was actually what Clause  said then something is amiss *end* The
Jewish world has showered the Rothschilds with praises "The Rothschilds govern a Christian world *end* Not a cabinet moves without their advice *end* They stretch their hand with equal ease from Petersburg to
Vienna from Vienna to Paris from Paris to London from London to Washington *end* Baron Rothschild
the head of the house is the true king of Judah the prince of the captivity the Messiah so long looked
for by this extraordinary people.. *end* .The lion of the tribe of Judah Baron Rothschild possesses more
real force than David--more wisdom than Solomon."  The Prieure de Sion-the Elders of Sion
also relates to the Rothschilds who are reported to serve on a jewish council of Elders of Sion *end* The
Rothschilds have "helped" the Jewish people the Rothschild’s own way *end* For those who admire
stingyness the Rothschilds will be greatly looked up to *end* For instance the extent of James
Rothschild’s charity in France to poor Jews was  francs the equivalent of  *end* Their dynasty has
destroyed honest Jews along with Christians *end* Today few dare criticize the Rothschilds *end*
CO-MASTERS OF THE WORLD--connections to secret societies

The Rothschilds had played a major role in the Bavarian Illuminati  and it is known that a least
one of the sons of Amsel was a member *end* As the reader remembers Amsel placed his sons in the
major European capitals where they each set up the principal banking houses *end* By their own secret

intelligence service and their own news network they could outmanouver any European government *end*  The large amounts of voluminous correspondence by Rothschild couriers attracted attention
but no one ever stopped their personal intelligence and mail services *end* After the Bavarian illuminati
were exposed the central occult power over the European secret societies shifted to Carbonarism

work in the nineteenth century than M *end* le Baron de Rothschild.. *end* .Was this Jew born a millionaire *end* No he was born poor and if only you knew what genius patience and hard work were required to
construct that European edifice called the House of Rothschild you would admire rather than insult
it." Lionel de Rothschild the de was added by the French Rothschilds was involved with the first
communist Internationale *end* The Mason Mazzini who helped start communism praised Rothschild
"Rothschild could be King of France if he so desired." Adoiphe Cremieux was a french Jewish
Mason see chap *end*  *end* for his credentials *end* The Rothschilds gave at least £ i  to Cremieux to go to
Damascus with Salomon Munk and Sir Moses Montefiore to win the release of Jews imprisoned
there and to convince the Turkish Sultan to declare the charges of ritual murder false *end* According to
the three Jewish authors of Dope Inc *end* the B’nai B’rith was a spin-off of the Order of Zion and was
organized as a covert intelligence front" for the House of Rothschild *end* It is highly probable that the
B’nai B’rith was used as a Rothschild intelligence cover *end* The Rothschilds are prominent in the
Bilderbergers too *end* The Rothschilds were closely related to the Council of Foreign Relations CFR *end* Although many people today would not view the CFR as a secret society it was originally set up as
part of a secret society and it was kept secret for many years in spite of its awesome power *end* Carroll
Quigley professor of International Relations at the Jesuit Georgetown University exposed the Round
Table Group with his book Tragedy and Hope *end* The Rothschilds supported Rhodes to form De

Esher Brett and  Mason Alfred Milner.bb A secondary circle of "potential members of the

replaced by his son-in-law Lord Rosebury who wasn’t as conspicuous *end* The Fabian Socialists
dominated the staff at Oxford when the Rhodes Scholars began arriving *end* These scholars then received
indoctrination and preparation to become part of an international socialist New World Order *end* The
Round Table Group developed from the inner executive circle of Rhode’s secret society *end* The outer
circle was established after the start of the  century *end* The Round Table Group was extended after
W.W *end* I by organizing a front organization the Royal Institute of International Affairs *end* The Council of
Foreign Relations was the American part of this front *end* The inner circle continues to direct the outer

CO-MASTERS OF THE WORLD--management of the Catholic and Czars’ wealth and the
capture of the Orthodox Church's wealth *end*
Early in the  century the Pope came to the Rothschilds to borrow money *end* The Rothschilds were
very friendly with the Pope causing one journalist to sarcasticly say "Rothschild has kissed the hand

of the Pope...Order has at last been re-established." The Rothschilds in fact over time were entrusted
with the bulk of the Vatican’s wealth *end* The Jewish Ency *end* Vol *end*  p *end* states It is a somewhat
curious sequel to the attempt to set up a Catholic competitor to the Rothschilds that at the present time
 the latter are the guardians of the papal treasure." Researcher Eustice Mullins writes that the
Rothschilds took over all the financial operations of the worldwide Catholic Church in  *end* Today the large banking and financial business of the Catholic Church is an extensive system
interlocked with the Rothschilds and the rest of the International Banking system *end* The great wealth of
the Russian Czars was entrusted to the Rothschilds  million with the Rothschild’s Bank of
England and  million in the Rothschild’s Paris bank *end* The Rothschilds financed the Russian
Revolution which confiscated vast portions of the Orthodox Church’s wealth *end* They have been able to
prevent due to their power the legitimate heirs of the Czars fortune to withdraw a penny of the
millions deposited in a variety of their banks *end* The Mountbattans who are related to the Rothschilds
led the court battles to prevent the claimants from withdrawing any of the fortune *end* In other words the
money they invested in the Russian Revolution was not only paid back directly by the Bolshevists in
millions of dollar of gold but by grabbing the hugh deposits of the Czars’ wealth the Rothschilds
gained what is now worth over  Billions *end*
CO-MASTERS OF THE WORLD--CONTROL OVER SATANISM & WITCHCRAFT

Chapter  *end* gives the names of a Witchcraft Council of  which is under Rothschild control and in
turn issue orders to various groups *end* One of the purest form of Satanism can be traced to the Jewish
Sabbatain sect and its Frankist spinoff *end* The leaders of this up to the Rothschilds were

Sabbatai Zevi -

Nathan of Gaza ??- *end*
Jacob Frank -

Three connections between Satanism evil and money *end*
Money naturally attracts itself to evil *end* For instance if a woman prostitutes herself she may receive a
great sum of money but who will pay her for keeping her virginity or her dignity *end* If you are a hit
man a large amount of money is yours if you kill your target who will pay you if you would miss
your target *end*
Second evil men believe in where there is a will there is a way and they are willing to sell their souls
for their God money *end* They will employ evil to gain money *end*
While most people are quite aware of these last two connections a third may likely have escaped
their attention *end* Thirdly the principle group of men who cranked up International Banking were
Satanists from the beginning *end* These Satanists now are the ones who run the Federal Reserve and are
responsible for the creation of U.S *end* Federal Reserve notes *end* Just having total control over the supply of
U.S *end* paper money almost gives them leverage over the world’s finances without mentioning they
control the world bank *end* It is no accident then that once they established world financial control they
would do all in their power to divide and conquer and destroy both the Christian and the Moslem faith
in God *end* These powerful Bankers relate to faith in God as Cain related to his brother Abel *end* That they
may be related to the Jewish people does not mean they have the Jewish people’s best interest at
heart *end* Initially Sabbetai Zevi was rejected by many Jews *end* His sect gained momentum in second half
of the seventeenth century in southeastern Poland *end* In -  Jewish Sabbateans
converted" to Christianity *end* In   of the  Jewish families in Frankfurt were engaged in
moneylending *end* The rest were merchants of various kinds *end* The concepts that Satanism holds to were a
natural shoe in to justify for many of these Jewish bankers the type of behavior they were engaged
in."

LONG-STORY SHORT

Many divisions and battles between religious elements in the world have been encouraged and
supported by the Power’s wealth *end* Unfortunately many have been fooled into thinking that being
devout and faithful to God is the source of religious fighting *end* In some areas of the world Moslems
Christians and others have gotten along fine for centuries *end* Religious tensions do spring to some
degree from within the religions themselves but the fuel to keep those fires burning and to light up
conflicts often come from the Power’s wealth *end* An obvious example is the Iran-Iraq war *end*
CO-MASTERS OF THE WORLD--CONTROL OVER W.W *end* I TREATY

Nations but Max Rothschild was one of  men who took control over Bavaria *end* Max Rothschild was

his money selling narcotics they weren’t illegal then *end* After acquiring a little capital he branched out
in oil *end* But it was the Rothschild capital that made the Rockefeller’s so powerful *end* "They also financed
the activities of Edward Harriman railroads and Andrew Carnegie Steel."

CO-MASTERS OF THE WORLD--Power within Christendom

The Rothschilds also wielded much influence and power not only in Secret Societies but also in
Christendom’s churches *end* The Salvation Army under the suggestion of the Rothschilds adopted the
Red Shield Roth-red Schild-shield for their logo *end* One history of the Rothschilds remarks "The
Rothschilds had rapidly propelled themselves into a position of immense financial power and political
influence *end* They were an independent force in the life of Europe accountable to no one and to a large
extent reliant on no one *end* Popular lampoons depicted them as the real rulers of Christendom..."
Some of the Rothschilds have been involved in the campaign to loosen public morals *end* The first
executive Secretary of the National Student Forum was John Rothschild *end* This National Student
Forum changed its name like articles of clothing *end* Speaking about clothing one of the aims of this
Socialist group was to promote public nudity and free love *end* This organization had the following
constituent groups Radcliffe Liberal Club Union Theological Seminary Contemporary Club Yale

important Federal Council of Churches of Christ official *end* See chap *end*  *end* Every road leads back to the
Rothschilds *end* There are more items than what have been mentioned above linking the Rothschilds to
the various tenticles *end* Each of the various tenticles that conspiracy theorists have put forth--the Jews
the Masons the Intelligence Communities the International Bankers the Prieure de Sion the
Catholics the Trilateral commission the CFR the New Age the Cults-- each ties back to the
Rothschild’s power *end*
EXTENT OF ROTHSCHILD POWER

According to one source "it was estimated that they controlled half the wealth of the world." The
Federal Reserve Bank of New York was controlled by five banks which owned % of its stock *end* These five banks were controlled by Nathan M *end* Rothschild & Sons of London *end* Control over the U.S *end* Fed is basically control over the world’s money *end* That fact alone shows how immense the Rothschild
Power is *end* If one examines who has been appointed to head the Fed and to run it the connections of
the "Federal" Reserve System to the Rothschilds can further be seen *end* Another private enterprise using
the name Federal that the Rothschilds also direct is Federal Express *end* Any one else might be taken to
court for making their businesses sound like their are government not the Rothschilds *end* It is
appropriate for them to appropriate the name of Federal because by way of MI via the CIA they
instruct the U.S *end* government *end* Senators are bought and paid off by their system as investigators of the
BCCI are discovering *end* The Rothschilds have been intimately involved in witchcraft and the Illuminati
since its early known history *end* The Kaiser of Germany seems to refer to them when he said "the magic
powers of money as wielded by the Lord of Lucre are powers of Black Magic at its blackest."

If only half of the wealth is controlled by the Rothschilds it indicates that if they are to be part of the
world’s rulership they must have allies *end*
ALLIES

The Rothschilds and Rockefellers are only two of thirteen controlling families of the Illuminati *end*
Two Jewish families that appear to be prominent are the Oppenheims and the Oppenheimers *end* A *end* Oppenheim was situated in Cologne *end* The Oppenheimers were early members of the Bavarian
Illuminati *end* The Bund der Gerechten League of the Just was an illuminati front run mainly by Jews
who were Satanists *end* This Bund financed in part by the Rothschilds paid the Satanist and Mason Karl
Marx to write the Communist Manefesto *end* The Jew Gumpel Oppenheim was in the inner circle of the
Bund *end* His relative Heinrich Oppenheim masterminded the communist revolution of  in
Germany *end* The Communist Party’s official histories even accept the Bund as the predecessor of
Communism *end*
The Oppenheimers apparently are close to the Rothschilds *end* J *end* Robert Oppenheimer of the CFR was
exposed as a communist *end* Harry Oppenheimer an international banker is chairman of the Jewish De
Beers world-wide diamond monopoly and chairman of the Anglo-American Corp *end* Oppenheimers can
be found in important financial positions in the U.S *end* They help run around  large foundations
including the Oppenheimer Haas Trust of NY for the care of needy Jewish children *end*
The Jewish Ency *end* Vol *end*  p *end*  indicates other Jewish families "adopted the Rothschild plan." These
were the Lazards Sterns Speyers and Seligmans *end* The Rothschild plan was to place family members
in the  largest European capitals to coordinate their activities *end* One of Germany’s largest magazines
is the Stern and Ernst Stern is second-in-command of the World Bank." The Jewish families that
established the Frankfurt Judenloge this was the Masonic lodge the Rothschilds belonged to in
Frankfurt included the Adlers Speyers Reisses Sichels Ellisons Hanaus Geisenheimers and
Goldschmidts *end* Isaac Hildesheim a Jew who changed his name to Justus Hiller is credited as being the
founder of this Frankfurt lodge *end* Michael Hess principal of the Reformed Jewish school Philanthropin
was an important figure in the lodge too as was Dr *end* Ludwig Baruch later Borne who joined in  *end* Most of these Frankfurt Jewish Freemasons engaged in commerce *end* Those Freemasons from -
 were the leaders of the Frankfurt Jewish community *end* A gentile Mason in Frankfurt Johann
Christian Ehrmann began warning the German people that the Frankfurt Jewish Masons wanted a
world republic based on humanism *end* In  he came out with a warning pamphlet Das Judenthum in
der Maurerey The Jews in Masonry *end* A powerful ally of the world’s jewry can be seen beginning
with men like Oliver Cromwell who was considered a Mason *end*
Cromwell was financed by Jews and helped the Jews gain power in England *end* Cromwell was willing
to go along with the Jews because he became convinced of British Israelism *end* Since the core of the
conspiracy of power is Jewish the attitude of those allied with it hinges on their attitude toward the
Jewish people *end*
The religious idea that the British people are descended from the tribes of Israel doesn’t automatically
place people into the camp of the conspiracy *end* Some of the British-Israelites realize that the so called
Jewish people in general have no claim over the promises of God *end* For that reason they realize that it
is not the Christian duty to bow and scrape at their every move *end* When Christians can be arrested in
Israel and abused and Christians will not even stand up for their own kind we can see how much
hold the idea of the "Chosen Race" theory has over Christendom *end* Some of the British Israelites such
as the Mormons the old New England wealthy families such as make up the Order some Masons and
New Agers and the non-Jewish members of the Priuere de Sion are collaborating with the One-
World-Power *end* The anglican church which is run by the Freemasons is strongly British Israelistic *end*
SORTING OUT THE VARIOUS IDENTITY GROUPS

In contrast a hodge-podge of groups which are opposed to the conspiracy like some Neo-Nazi
groups and various Churches unrelated with them are also believers in British Israelism *end* These
various groups are sometimes all lumped together as the "Identity" movement which is misleading
because of their vast differences *end* It is important to diferentiate between those groups that are trying to
approach things from a Christian perspective and place themselves under the authority of God and
those who are setting themselves up under the New Order’s authority or under their own authority *end*
CO-MASTERS OF THE WORLD- The Media

Eustice Mullins has published his research in his book Who Owns the TV Networks showing that the
Rothschilds have control of all three U.S *end* Networks plus other aspects of the recording and mass
media industry *end* It can be added that they control Reuters too *end* From other sources it appears CNN
which began as an independent challenge to the Jewish Network monopoly ran into repeated
trickery and ended up part of the system *end* Money from B.C.C.I *end* B.C.C.I *end* has been one of the New
World Orders financial systems for doing its dirty business such as controlling Congressmen and is
involved with INSLA the Iran-Contra Scandal Centrust and other recent scandals which has tainted
so many aspects of public power in the U.S *end* has also been behind CNN *end* Perhaps nothing dominates
the life of some Americans as does the television *end* Americans sit themselves before the television set
and simply absorb what it projects to them *end* On a day to day basis the biggest way the Rothschilds
touch the lives of Americans are the three major networks which are under Rothschild direction *end* To
illustrate this we will examine who run the networks *end* This list is not current and no attempt was to
provide that *end* The length of writing a book insures that some material will be dated anyway *end*
THE ROTHSCHILD’S HISTORY BY A JEWISH WRITER RELATED TO THE
ROTHSCHILDS

Jewish writer Anka Muhlstcin wrote a book Baron James The Rise of the French Rothschilds *end* I prefer
paraphrase and make short quotes from her book because I am trying to document for the reader the
mindset and history of thc Rothschilds *end* Anka Muhlstein has nothing against the Rothschilds so it will
be easier for the reader to accept what shc says about them than from me *end* I can’t require the reader to
read her book but I can try to summarize some of the appropriate thoughts *end* Other books also relate
many of the things Anka does but again if I write a footnoted article it will not carry the weight as
my paraphrase will *end* The reader is recommended to read the book first hand if he has the time and is
interested in the details of James’ life *end* The Jews in the  century were restricted to living in

communities were very tight- knit and highly organized *end* p *end* They were deeply hostile to the
Christian people *end* Christians had restricted their own people from money-lending with interest so
lending money on interest had become a Jewish enterprise *end* The German princes of Thurn and Taxis
in the  century initiated a postal service *end* Mayer Amschel loaned them money *end* p *end* "Certainly

this period always manuevering to avoid any kind of political commitment *end* "p *end* One of the things
Mayer Amschel set up was to disperse his  sons to the major capitals of Europe *end* Anka attributes the
respectibility of Jewish money lending to the help it gave merchants and entrepreneurs *end* See chap *end*  *end* -this Author’s view is that merchants had been borrowing for centuries prior to interest taking
becoming acceptable by society in the  century *end* It was greatly in part due to who owned and
controlled the major newspapers in the  century--Jews and Masons--that led the public to
change *end* "The obligation to reimburse a loan and to pay interest became less onerous to men whose
affairs had flourished as a result of the borrowed money *end* The Jewish lender ceased to be a
bloodsucker; often indeed he became an associate of the borrower." p *end* The Bible says a
borrower is a slave to the lender hardly an association to be desired *end* The business of financing
Monarchs was lucrative *end* The Rothschilds had developed several traits in the ghetto that made their
family hard to stop *end* "The great gift the Frankfurt ghetto bestowed upon him James Rothschild was
adaptibility a quality matched by the driving force of his ambition his prodigious energy
tremendous powers of concentration and determination to get even with Christians *end* James set out to
make his place in the world." p *end* The five Rothschild brothers each in the five major European
capitals set up their own private courier system which was faster than the regular mail *end* p *end* The
Rothschilds had news whether political or economic faster than anyone else including the monarchs *end* "Thus the Rothschilds had news before anyone else including ministers govt.; they also understood
how to make use of it." p *end* Somewhat akin to how money could be made off of knowing the
future *end* The Rothschilds nomal correspondence to each other was in code.p *end* Their world was one
of finance politics and secrecy *end* In the anti-Napoleonic time period the Rothschilds increased their
wealth ten-fold *end* p *end* "...James *end* He enjoyed moreover a rock-solid strength and stability built up
by his family that family simultaneously closed tight like a fist united by mutual confidence and an
invisible wall of secrecy yet wide open to the outside world *end* Such was the cohesion of the
Rothschilds that the removal of one or more of them left no gap in their common defenses."

The Rothschilds carried out espionage with their own intelligence service and other questionable
subversive activities but none of these could be tracked *end* "Whenever Mayer Amschel and his sons
were on the verge of being caught out some highly placed person stepped in and stopped the
investigation." p *end*
The made their money doing technically illegal activity *end* The original large sum of money made was
to take the Elector of Hesse’s large sum and instead of investing it into government bonds as directed-
-to put it to use at investments of higher returns and giving the elector the return from the
government bonds *end* Anka writes "The Elector was never the wiser but even if he had been he could
hardly have complained of disobedience." p *end* In summary the Mafia-like closeness of the
Rothschild family along with their tactic to situate themselves in all the major capitals along with
their own quick secret personal news/intelligence/mail service gave them the contacts and the power
to manipulate all kinds of business opportunities *end*

WHERE DOES NAZISM FIT INTO SATAN’S PLANS *end*
Let me briefly recap what some of the plan was  *end* And while you read these plans that I am relaying to
you from my intensive research on high level Satanism see if you don’t see the irony in the Satanic
plans  *end* How very ironic it is that in all the twisted thinking and reasoning of the leading Satanists for
why they must do things it is surprising they do not catch on that this plan of Satan’s is going to
achieve God’s revealed plan  *end* How pride does blind us *end* For the sake of brevity I will dispense with
my normal method of documenting everything; I suggest that my book Be Wise As Serpents be read
for documentation and further questions be written to me  *end* Otherwise this article would be way to
bulky for the newsletter *end* The "brilliant" plan given in detail to the Illuminati was to create a thesis
and its opposite called the antithesis  *end* The process would repeat itself until the desired outcome  *end* Out
of the battle between the two would emerge the synthesis  *end* Out of the battle of chaos would come a

new order reminding us of the Masonic slogan "Order out of Chaos." If the thesis were like a hammer
and the antithesis like an anvil what was caught in between would be broken or reshaped  *end* Three
world wars would enable the plan to work *end* The hammer would be constructed and then given a
homeland a secure base in Russia  *end* It is what we call communism *end* The first anvil would be created
out of economic chaos in Germany  *end* It would be called National Socialism  *end* That anvil would be
destroyed in a Second World War but another anvil would replace it called democracy *end* The first two
world wars accomplished exactly what they were intended to accomplish *end* Out of the first world war
came

 A secure Satanic dictatorship in Russia a secure base to carry out further world subversion *end*
 The Satanic family of Rothschilds gained partial control over Palestine preparing the way for
Satan to rule from Jerusalem some day

 Weapons of mass destruction and terror *end*
 The League of Nations *end*
Out of the second world war came

 The enlargement of their secure base in Russia into a world power *end*
 complete control over Palestine by the Rothschilds *end*
 airpower including long range missiles jets secret flying saucers and powerful submarines all
items that individuals could not produce  *end* Those in control of production would therefore control all
air and sea ways of the earth *end*
 The cold war and an era of terror to convince the people of the need for Satan’s One World Order *end*
 the United Nations  *end*
Out of the third world war would emerge a new religious system  *end* The third world war would have to
be tailored to be like the Bible’s Armaggeddon Satan told his highest slaves because- if it resembled
Armaggeddon then the people would believe he was the Messiah when he came after its end  *end* It
would have to be terrible so that he could step in and bring miraculous order out of a world beaten
into chaos by the worst war in history *end* Again it would be "Order out of chaos" as the Masonic
documents repeatedly proclaim *end* The third world war would come during a period of seven years of
tribulation starting in  and running until  *end* Just like the Second World War emerged out of
the great world-wide depression *end* Satan told his followers this - tribulation would repeat on a
larger scale the plagues of Egypt for he would wreck revenge for what was done to Egypt by God
and Moses by giving back in a bigger way to the world what happened to ancient Egypt  *end* To a
demonic controlled mind it makes sense to wreck such revenge especially when the end result is held
out to be the salvation of the world by the Lightbearer the Morning Star also known as Lucifer *end* For
most of us the idea of such pain and destruction seems like demonic madness- - which it is  *end*
At the core of the One-World-System is Satanism *end* It hides itself behind fronts such as Jewish
Finance Socialism Aryanism British Israelism Zionism and Freemasonry which are tools to get the
broad masses to serve the Plan *end* The "conspiracy" to create the One-World-System has enlisted the
help of almost everyone *end* That is because most of the religious systems at the top are controlled by
Satanists who know what they are doing and direct the people’s religious efforts *end* Read the research
in Be Wise As Serpents for the documentation on this *end* Nazism was a Pagan Gnostic religious system
whose High Priest Hitler knew what he was doing in relation to Satan’s mission *end* More about this
further down *end* The Jewish people  use the term in its broadest sense are being used *end* Actually the
allegiance of the Satanic hierarchy is not in the least concerned with Judaism although it appears that
at first the plans are to create a religious leader that will have the apparent credentials of the Jewish
messiah *end* How sad because the actions of the Rothschilds and other Satanic "jewish" bloodlines

during W.W *end* II show that their first allegiance is not to the Old Testament and not to even Orthodox
Judaism but is purely to Satan *end* At some point in the future the Orthodox Jews and the Conservative
Jews will find that this Messiah who is already alive waiting to play his role will only give them
temporary relief *end* They are being taken for a ride and then they will be dumped by the New World
Order’s dictatorship *end*
Constance Cumbey correctly notices that the New Age movement resembles Nazism exactly to a T  *end* For those students wanting to get a detail by detail parallel go to pages  to  in The Hidden
Dangers Of The Rainbow *end*
In  James Larratt Battersby in England published The Holy Book of Adolf Hitler for the German
World Church in Europe  *end* Except for some of his pro-German ideas obviously thrown in to make the
book enlist the intended audience’s favor the book is an exact description of what would happen in
the next  years to bring in the New World Order *end* The reason some of the prognostications of pro-
German ideas are not valid is that the Satanic hierarchy is not really concerned for the German people
either except to harness their help in their plans  *end* Batterby’s Holy Book of Adolf Hitler was given to
him "in the spirit"  *end* According to Battersby the book was written in order that "May God open the
eyes of the Gentiles to Truth and carry his Holy Gospel to the ends of the earth"  *end* The book is an
excellent synopsis of what Satan had planned in  and has carried out since to a large degree *end* The
Rothschilds and other top Satanic families in a lesser way financed a jewish Mason and devote
Satanist named Karl Marx to write his Das Kapital  *end* The Satanists controlling key Masonic groups
along with some other groups they controlled got Communism started *end* The original idea came from
Satan and was given at a Feast of the Beast in meticulous detail to those highest in the Satanic
Hierarchy  *end* Albert Pike and Guiseppe Mazzini were two men in strategic positions of control that
were let in on the plans *end*
After creating International Socialism communism a temporary antithesis was created called
National Socialism nazism *end* The process to create National Socialism was to turn again to the
Masonic Lodges and other esoteric secret Societies to get it done *end* Therefore the secret esoteric
gnostic and satanic societies along with the Illuminati helped create "the Thule Gesellshaft" in
English the Thule Society  *end* Adolf Hitler was some type of member of this occult Thule Society
along with many other men who later began leading Nazi leaders such as Rudolf Hess *end* The Thule
Society used the Masonic/Hindu symbol the Swastika which the Nazi party then also used as its
symbol *end* In other words the grandmother of the Nazi Party was the Masonic Lodges in Germany *end* The
Vril was another secret occult group that many of the Nazi leadership belonged to *end* Hitler also was a
member of the Theosophical Society which has strong Satanic and Masonic ties *end* Both Bailey and
Hitler studied from Tibetians Hindus occultists and black magicians *end* They also both studied the
Gnostics and every major Pagan/Occult religious system *end* A example of how valued the Swastika was
for Freemasons before Hitler ruined its image is a quote from Joseph Fort Newton a Baptist Minister
and high ranking Mason "The second of these volumes also contains an essay *end*  *end*  *end* by Thomas Carr
with a list of Lodges and a study of their history customs and emblems- -especially the Swastika  *end* Speculative Masons are now said to be joining. *end* seeking more light on what are called the Lost
Symbols of Masonry." After promoting and using the Swastika for years the Freemasons quit using it
after Hitler *end* The Holy Book of Hitler provides the answer as to why the Theosophical Society worked
so hard to destroy the British Empire *end* It had always at first mystified me why the Theosophical
Society Presidents who connected to the Satanic hierarchy would want to ruin the British Empire *end* The
reason it seemed strange is that the mother country of Satanism and Witchcraft is Great Britian *end* The
center of secret political power is geographically in England *end* And further one of the largest and most
powerful secret fronts for Satanism is Britism-Israelism *end* The reason why the British Empire was
destroyed was that Satan had already determined even before  that the steps to world government
would include setting up around  or  Continental blocs  *end* The Union of Europe into one country or
bloc could not be accomplished while Great Britian had most of her focus on her empire *end* Great
Britian as long as she had an empire would never want to join up with Europe *end* In fact all the
European nations would have to be convinced to give up their colonies that is why the World Power
got everyone they could get to help fight Portugal in Angola in recent history everyone including the

large masonic-controlled Christian denominations who donated millions of dollars to the NCC and
WCC which moneys were then passed on to the guerillas to buy weapons and ammo *end*
The Theosophical Society is mostly to blame for India’s independence from Britian  *end* First the
Theosophical Society managed to change British policy so that the British became unpopular *end* Then
Theosophical President Besant who published the largest English paper strongly criticized British
rule in her newspapers and eventually was arrested  *end* Gandhi and other Indian leaders were involved in
Besant being made the President of the Indian Congress Party *end* And that political party still rules
Indian politics  *end* The Theosophist Mahatma Gandhi foilowing in the steps of Theosophical President
Annie Besant led the Indian people against British rule *end*
But the final blow to the British Empire was done by another Theosophist--Adolf Hitler *end* It is
common knowledge that the powerful blows of Axis attacks in W.W *end* II struck the death blow to the
British Empire or so we are told *end* The truth is that the elite wanted the Empire to die and pulled every
string to convince the British public and indigenous natives that the Empire was too weak after W  *end* W
 *end* II to save the empire and prevent her colonies from independence *end* It is hard for people to grasp that
the Illuminati controlled Russia Great Britian Germany and France during World War II but they
did *end* Churchill Roosevelt and Stalin were all Masons  *end* DeGaulle of France was closely linked with
several esoteric groups and the Priere de Sion and Grand Orient Masons helped him to power in the
s  *end* Churchill was a Zionist and pro-Fabian Socialist  *end* Stalin was a closet satanist  *end* Roosevelt was a
Zionist pro-communist and socialist  *end* Both Churchill and Roosevelt came from important elite blood
lines  *end* Apparently Stalin was somewhat independent but basically did what was expected of him *end* As
the previous paragraph indicates the people of the world weren’t ready for a world government and
most not even a united Europe *end* W.W *end* II was carried out to adjust people’s thinking toward wanting
European unity  *end* Satan already ruled the world through his secret chain of command but he wanted to
openly rule the world’s hearts and to be publicly hailed as ruler and savior *end*
Who was Hitler *end* Hitler’s father was the offspring of the Rothschild’s secret breeding program which
impregnated his grandmother *end* It appears from the details available Hitler was groomed for his role
without realizing his heritage at first  *end* It appears that Hitler learned of his jewish bloodline" after
taking over Germany *end* Hitler had romances with many beautiful women *end* Although Hitler was very
strict with his New Age religious practices such as being a vegitarian that did not include being
celebrate  *end* He did have sex contrary to the deceptions of the Establishment *end* Hitler’s seed the
Rothschild’s powerful generational occult bloodline was hidden in an Askenazim bloodline at least
part of which has come to the U.S *end* In fact Hitler’s generational occult power was passed on too  *end* This
was most likely done by thrusting a knife into his heart and the person who received his occult power
then gulped his last breath with the kiss of death to receive his occult power  *end* What I am telling you is
that Hitler’s offspring are alive and well and that his terrifying Anti-Christ spirit was passed to
someone and is not dead *end* Let me remind you of some of Hitler’s own prophecies about himself and
his goals *end* "At the time of supreme peril I must die a martyr’s death for the people *end* But after my death
will come something really great an overwhelming revelation to the world of my mission." The
world was to witness his divinity  *end* Further "My spirit will rise from the grave and the world will see
that I was right." Von Ribbentrop on Apr *end*   was told this same thing "You will see that my
spirit will rise from the grave  *end* " National Socialism "is even more than a religion; it is the will to
make mankind anew." "All creative energy will pass to the new man." Hitler claimed to be the real
fulfillment of Marx’s socialism *end* "I am not only the conqueror but also the executor of Marxism of
that part of it which is essential and justified stripped of its Jewish-Talmudic dogma." In essense he
is saying whatever veneer of Jewishness that Marx’s satanic plan had he disagreed with it and would
destroy that veneer  *end* These type of statements reveal that the essence of the message of various elite
men like Hitler is the same Satanic plan if stripped of their variously decorated veneers  *end*
Hitler is viewed as the Messiah the Holy Spirit the martyred Savior of his people by his followers
today *end* The blasphemous Holy Book of Adolf Hitler states "All hail to God’s Christ and Chosen
Adolf Hitler...Lord of Lords and King of Kings the Eternal Adolf Hitler." Such blasphemy  *end* Father
forgive them for they know not what they do *end* Hitler’s Demonic Spirit and Hitler’s descendents both
live on today *end* By the way some Rothschild descendents such as Hitler’s have come to Christ as their

Lord and Savior *end* Will this powerful occult branch of the Rothschild’s be used again by the New
World Order *end* Whatever the case it is clear that Hitler’s Anti-Christ spirit will get plenty of demonic
help *end* The demonic forces that have manifested themselves in National Socialism and International
Socialism aka Communism demonized much of Europe *end* So much so that Europe officially portrays
itself as a beast with Venus on it on a stamp commemorating the Second election of the European
Parliament and also as the same forces that tried to build the Tower of Babel on an official poster *end* Not only are the same demons that led communist leaders and nazi leaders operating in Europe’s
leaders but there are armies of demons trampling over anything of moral value in Europe  *end* It can be
said without a doubt that the man" who rules the One-World-Government will derive his power
from a demonic supernatural source  *end* According to Revelations God is going to have an angel open
up a key to the abyss and teeming hordes of demonic spirits shall be decending upon the earth  *end* My
conclusion is that Satan has so many Anti-Christs available that Hitler’s personal occult power is not
necessary for the New World Order’s success  *end*
I rarely like to comment on the end times from Scriptures because I feel like most people are
thoroughly confused about the clear teachings that the Scriptures give *end*  Thes *end*  and other
Scriptures make it clear that the Christians must witness a great apostasy and the Anti-Christ being
revealed before Christ returns  *end* We can live everyday as if it may be our last but Scriptures are clear
that the Apostles did not live each day as if Jesus could return that day *end* They knew that certain things
had to happen first  *end* The church has been going through tribulations since Pentecost  *end* The church will
go through the "great tribulation" according to the Word of God  *end* We will if we are that faithful
remnant we will be spared from the Wrath of God but we will not be spared from the tribulation of
Satan which shall include martyrdom  *end* The New Age leaders are fully ready to cooperate with this
"cleansing" from the earth of us bothersome disciples of Truth *end* In this respect their thinking will
resemble the Nazi’s rationalizations that people must pay their Karmic debt and shall benefit from
being killed  *end* How truth can be stood on its head *end* The Plans are already drawn up how to use rail
lines to move large groups of civilians to labor camps  *end* When we compare Nazi Germany with
today’s New World Order plans Nazi Germany can be seen to be the basic model of what Satan’s
timetable includes for us these next few years  *end*
To illustrate that the Pagan religion of Nazism is an example to the Satanists and New Agers let us
ponder Anton LaVey’s head of a visible Church of Satan trip to the sacred initiation castle of
Hitler’s Black Order the SS  *end* The SS apparently brought the Holy Grail to Germany and hid it before
the end of the war  *end* On May   a select group of SS officers those initiated into the higher
mysteries of the Nazi Pagan religion hid the Grail in the Schleigeiss glacier at the foot of  meter
high Hochfeiler mountain  *end* Seekers in the area have been found decaptitated and mutilated  *end* The area
is still guarded by the Black Order in anticipation of the day that the Grail can be revealed to the
world  *end* It has been speculated  might be the date but this is pure speculation  *end* The important
thing for us is to begin to experience the Kingdom of God right now  *end* Let us prepare ourselves for
Almighty God’s New World Order as the Satanists launch their counterfeit New World Order *end*


THE ROTHSCHILDS

A CONTINUATION OF ARTICLES ON THE TOP  ILLUMINATI FAMILIES

INTRODUCTION by Fritz Springmeier

The Rothschilds are one of the most well-known of the thirteen families *end* David J *end* Smith of Portland
was asked to prepare an article on the Rothschilds for this newsletter *end* His article follows this
introduction *end* Satan’s selective breeding program has been continuing down through the ages hidden
from the eyes of the public *end* One of the most powerful Rothschild bloodline families in America are
the Springs *end* The Springs were originally the Springsteins when they came to America in the mid-I
s and settled in NY and NJ *end* They later changed their name from Springstein to Springs to hide
their identity *end* Leroy Springs was hired by LC *end* Payseur *end* Now most American’s have to ask who is

L.C *end* Payseur *end* One of the most secret and most powerful families in North America has been the
Payseurs *end* They have been so powerful that they could hide their wealth and power and use other
Satanic families as proxies *end* The Payseurs are part of the i  top Illuminati family *end* The first Payseur
to come to America was the former crown prince of France Daniel Payseur - *end* He came
over about  to the U.S *end* and married Susannah Kiser c *end*  *end* They had two boys Adam and Jonas
-  *end* Jonas married Harrietta Smith and they had Lewis Cass Payseur - *end* It was
this Lewis Cass Payseur who hired the Rothschild bloodline of the Springs to run a number of the
Payseur’s companies *end* The Payseurs were one of the original big railroad families along with Issac
Croom and William H *end* Beatty *end* Isaac Croom’s wife was a sister of William Beatty’s so the reader can
see how all these elite bloodlines intertwine *end* Remember that LC *end* Payseur hired Leroy Springs to
operate a host of his companies *end* Leroy Springs father was A.A *end* Springs and A.A *end* Springs was the
secret father of Abraham Lincoln *end*
In  Nancy Hanks of the lineage of the McAdden Scottish family visited some of her famIly at
Lincolnton N.C *end* Nancy Hawks visited the Springs family and that is when A.A *end* Springs impregnated
her and her child when born was named Abraham Lincoln *end* Abraham Lincoln’s Rothschild blood was
kept very secret but he did grow up to be a famous lawyer a secret leader of the Rosicrucians and
President of the United States *end* It is believed from the evidence that the establishment conspiracy
concocted the person of Thomas Lincoln out of thin air *end* The actual early history of Abraham Lincoln
is shrouded in myth and mystery and as one encyclopedia puts it "We know little about the family of
his mother Nancy Hanks Lincoln." While a lawyer Abraham Lincoln had a sexual liaison with
Elizabeth who was the illegitimate daughter of German King Leopold who is also of elite blood
lineage *end* Abraham Lincoln and Elizabeth had two twin daughters Ella and Emily in  who were
adopted out *end* Lincoln in fact had a fairly large number of illegitimate children *end* Now A *end* A *end* Springs
who was both the biological father of Leroy Springs and Abraham Lincoln left an enormous amount
of land in what is now Huntsville AL to his son Abraham Lincoln *end* Huntsville AL by the way has
become a hotbed of NWO activity *end* Some of the mind-control research the intelligence community has
been conducting has been done at Huntsville *end* The Rothschilds even named one of their boys after
Abraham Lincoln his name was Lincoln Rothschild *end* Although Abraham Lincoln secretly had
powerful occult blood he was a great man in his own right *end* And just like JFK he had the strength of
personality to refuse to bow to the Illuminati’s instructions *end* Lincoln refused to go the path that his
distant European International Banking Rothschild relatives wanted for the United States *end* The
Illuminati goal had been to split the U.S *end* into two easier to control nations *end* And just as with JFK who
also came from a top  family a large scale conspiracy Involving many government officials
including the Secretary of Defense was put into place to assassinate Lincoln *end* There are numerous
indications that show that the Rothschilds were in part behind the assassination of Lincoln *end* Some of
the men who worked for the Payseurs of the  top family were Andrew Carnegie J.P *end* Morgan the
Vanderbilts Giftord Pinnchot and John D Rockefeller *end* These men were selected to run Payseur
companies because they belonged to the satanic elite *end* The Leroy Springs family got Payseur family
companies in the early s *end* It was Leroy that managed to get the Rothschild’s involved with the
Federal Reserve *end* Two companies that have come out of the Payseur’s old Lancaster Manufacturing
Co *end* ins Weyerhaeuser and Crown-Zellerbach *end* I have long know these were companies tied to the
elite but it wasn’t until i found the secret Payseur family at the very top of these companies that I
really understood the full story *end* The Payseurs have gone to extreme lengths to corrupt government
documents such as courthouse records *end* They have hidden the births of many of their descendants
and have covered over with extreme secrecy most of their monetary holdings *end*
Remember the Beatty family was an early railroad family with business ties to the Payseur family *end* Bartholomew F *end* Moore who was the private attorney for years to President Abraham Lincoln was a
blood relative of the Beatty family *end* It was Bart Fingers Moore who co-authored the  amendment
for the conspiracy *end* The Beatty family continually resurfaces when doing research on the conspiracy *end* Shirley MacLaine the famous New Age leader/author is from the Beatty family *end* She credits her start
to Edgar Cayce by the way who in turn was interested in Blavatsky *end* Blavatsky was a student of the
Mason Anton Mesmer who introduced the world to hypnotism *end* Hypnotism had been secretly
practiced by the Mystery Religions for thousands of years before Mesmer taught Blavatsky and others

about it *end* Charles Beatty Alexander who is an Illuminati  prince"/Pilgrim Society member is an
example of a Beatty in recent times who was within the elite *end* Quantrill who was a famous
Confederate colonel and guerilla leader whose band of raiders evolved into the Jessie James gang
was married into the Springs Rothschild family

The recent lala Madelyn Payseur Gatling Fulghum - was the late head of the Payseur
family *end* The documentation on the above families is extensive but much of the evidence that has been
photocopied out of the few documents left intact have been destroyed since the documents were
photocopied *end* The amount of tampering with official documents is incredible and further Illustrates
the enormous power the Rothschilds and the Payseurs the  family--the Holy Blood line have *end* The researchers who wrote Holy Blood Holy Grail got a taste of the power of the  blood line to
manipulate documents held by libraries and governments in Europe *end* The same type of thing has been
happening in the United States *end* The researcher into the Satanic elite has a hard row to hoe because the
Satanic families have tried to cover their tracks through history *end* They have also tried very hard to
cover up what their financial assets are *end* Those Rothschilds who have carried on the Rothschild name
have had a higher visibility *end* It is this group of Rothschilds which have gained the public’s attention
even though they too are very secretive *end*
The origins of the Masonic and Rosicrucian movements lie with the medieval alchemists *end* Manly P *end* Hall Freemasonry’s greatest philosopher writes During the Middle Ages alchemy was not only a
philosophy and a science but also a religion *end* Those who rebelled against the religious limitations of
their day concealed their philosophic teachings under the allegory of gold-making *end* In this way they
preserved their personal liberty and were ridiculed rather than persecuted *end* Alchemy is a threefold art
its mystery well symbolized by a triangle." The Secret Teachings of All Ages pg CLIV-ul -- Manly
P Hall also states in his book on magic entitled Magic ".. *end* the pentagram *end* This was known to
medieval alchemy as the sign of the cloven hoof ... *end* Hall. *end* Magic Los Angeles CA Philosophical
Research Soc *end* pg *end*  QuicksIlver which was one of the things the early Astor family traded in was
one of the primary items employed in the aichemical trarismutations *end* The oxide produced using
quicksilver was considered magical and mystically identified with the god Osiris *end* As the reader may
have already figured out alchemy practiced Hermetic magic from ancient Egypt *end* Alchemy was really
a front for the mystery religion of Satanic witchcraft *end* The leading alchemist was a german Richard
Bauer who was alive sometime in the  or  hundreds *end* Richard Bauer is said to have been the only
alchemist who was successful in transforming lead to gold *end* Whether that report is meant in an
allegorical way or some other way I do not know What I am trying to communicate is that the Bauer
family was a leading alchemical family which secretly practiced Hermetic magic during the late
Middle Ages *end* David’s article on the Rothschilds is meant to be an extension of what I have already
put out on the Rothschilds *end* for instance my chapter  *end* in the Be Wise As Serpents book *end* Chapter  *end* is entirely devoted to the Rothschilds *end* I chose them to write about in the book because the family is
the most renown of the Satanic families and the easiest to expose to people just becoming acquainted
with what is going on *end* The other family which has a chapter devoted to it is the Russell family which
is described in chapter  *end*  *end* The Russell family has yet to be covered in this series but was covered in
the Be Wise As Serpents book because of their importance to the Watchtower Bible & Tract Society *end* I am aware of intense secret meetings that have been going on in Frankfurt and Moscow between
World Bank officials *end* These secret meetings have been going on now for two months which gives
some of the scope of their importance *end* Undoubtedly the Rothschilds are playing a role in these secret
meetings even while I write this *end* There has been a great deal of misinformation put out that the
Rothschilds and the Rockefellers are fighting for control of the world *end* It is true that they are in intense
competition in some areas *end* It has also been true that they have been in intense cooperation in many
areas *end* One of the difficulties for people to sort out what is going on is that they don’t know about the
Satanic spiritual dimension of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers *end* For instance to make an analogy
if I am a minister and one of my brothers-in-Christ is my upline on a multi-level marketing
distributorship then he is my business head but I could be the spiritual leadership that he looks up to *end* The point is that essentially all researchers trying to expose the NWO are drawing conclusions about
occult power on the basis of business relationships and it doesn’t always work *end* Sometimes the
business boss may be in a secret satanic leadership position over someone else but it may also be that

both men are on equal footing when it comes to occuft power and status within the Illuminati *end* So far I
have seen only one book advertised and I haven’t read it which claims to expose the conflict
between the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers as a sham *end* If It really does show this then the book has
contributed greatly toward helping people tear down their isunderstandings about the Illuminati
power structure *end*


Part I

THE HOUSE OF ROTHSCHILD

If one looked on the backstage of history he would find the House of Rothschild *end* They have indebted
Kings manipulated kingdoms created wars and molded the very shape of the international world *end* Among the hierarchy of the Illuminati they are revered as a powerful satanic bloodline *end* They are
"living legends."

Said one biographer "In America a boy wants to become President *end* In Europe he would rather be a
Rothschild... *end* To be ‘a Rothschild’ is to be a modern Croesus a twentieth-century Midas." They are a
dynasty of enduring power; a "magic" bloodline In Satan’s Empire *end* We will probably never know
exactly when occultism was introduced to the Rothschilds *end* Several of their ancestors have been
rabbis so the occultism probably came in the form of Jewish Cabalism Sabbatism or Frankism *end* The
House of Rothschild practices gnostic-satanism the Rothschilds would probably not call themselves
satanists but by our standards they are considering the sacrificial and spiritual worship involved *end* The truth is sometimes hard to tell *end* The stories the family weave are hard to distinguish from the
truth *end* Myths are one of their best weapons and a researcher must be wary *end* The family began in
Frankfort Germany the city where paper money was popularized *end* The oldest known Rothschild
went by the name of Uri Feibesch who lived in the early  century *end* His descendants lived in the
House of Red Shield *end* His great great great great Grandson was Moses Bauer who lived in the early
 century *end* The family was mostly made-up of Jewish retail traders and lived in the Judengasse or
Jew’s Alley in Frankfort *end* Jew’s Alley was the product of the anti-semitic bent in Europe and did not
have very good living conditions *end*
Most Ashkenazim Jews of that time did not use sir-names instead they preferred the Chinese custom
of using a symbol as the family identity *end* These symbols were sometimes used on signs outside Jewish
houses as an address *end* Some Jews had taken on sir-names to fit in but the use of symbols was more
popular *end* The early Rothschilds chose the sir-name Bauer meaning farmer in German *end* Why would a
family of retail traders call themselves Bauer *end* Perhaps to remain un-noticed *end* The Bauer line
continues today but in the ’s one man re-named his branch of the family after its symbol and
address - the Red Shield or the Seal of Solomon *end*
Mayer Amschel Bauer was a well-off coin trader in Frankfort *end* In front of his house hung a sign with
the family’s symbol which was a red hexagram *end* The hexagram also known as the Seal of Solomon
the Magden David or the Star of David is very occultic *end* It is used today as the symbol of Israel but
It is not Jewish." In his excellent book THE SIX-POINTED STAR O.J *end* Graham explains that the
hexagram was used in the ancient mystery religions *end* It was the symbol of Moloch Ashtoreth and
others *end* In fact the hexagram was used to represent Saturn which earlier newsletters have discussed *end* The six-pointed star is considered the equivalent of the Oriental Yin-and-Yang symbol which is the
Luciferian concept of balancing good and evil *end* The symbol appears to have been used by King
Solomon when he apostasized and was thereafter called the Seal of Solomon *end* Later on Jewish
Cabalism or Occultism - different name same game picked it up as a magic symbol *end* Through the
promotion of the Cabalists and the Zionists it has become the symbol of Jewish identity although the
occult circles know better *end* The Bauer’s use of a hexagram as their family sign points to their
involvement in Jewish Cabalism *end* In fact the six-pointed star was so significant to them that Mayer
Amschel Bauer decided to adopt it as his new name - Mayer Amschel Rothschild Rot-schildt = Red
Shield *end* I believe this was done to identify his family with occultism and the likes of Saturn or

Ashtoreth whom the Astors are named after *end* Mayer was sent to be a rabbi when he was  in  *end* A year and a half later his parents died *end* Mayer was brilliant and was encouraged by relatives to
continue his studies but coin trading was his love *end* He left the school and when  was sent to
Hanover to be an apprentice at the Illuminati Oppenheimer bank *end* He worked there for  years
learning the ins and out of money *end* The big question is why he left the Oppenheimer bank *end* It was a
good situation both financially and socially Hanover was less antagonistic towards the Jews than
Frankfort *end* Why leave this security and head back home to an uncertain future *end* Because the future
wasn’t all that uncertain *end* While in Hanover Mayer made the acquaintance of General von Estorff a
numismatist who was impressed by Mayer’s knowledge of the subject *end* In  General von Estorff
left Hanover and joined the Court of Prince William IX of Hesse-Hanau whose territory included
Frankfort *end* Mayer knew that through his connections he would be able to get some business with the
Prince *end* It appears Mayer’s stay at the Oppenheimer bank was used to establish himself in Illuminati
circles and to find a way to get close to the Illuminati royalty *end* General von Estorff was his key *end*
Prince William of Hesse-Hanau was tied into the Illuminati *end* He was the son of Landgrave Frederick
or Hesse-Cassel of the royal family of Hesse *end* Prince William was a Freemason and his younger
brother Karl was according to JEWS AND FREEMASONS IN EUROPE - ‘accepted as
the head of all German Freemasons.’ Members of the Hesse dynasty have been described as the
leaders of the Strict Observance in  a Masonic Congress in Wilhelmsbad a city in the Hesse
province dropped the name ‘Strict Observance’ and changed it to "Beneficent Knights of the Holy
City" *end* The Hesse dynasty is totally connected to the Illuminati *end* Prince William was the grandson of
King George II of England *end* The Hesse-Cassel’s were one of the richest royal houses in Europe *end* Their
income came mainly from the loaning-out of Hessian soldiers to foreign countries *end* The elite loves to
makes profit off of "peacekeeping" troops which is exactly what the Hessians were called *end* This
"peacekeeping" always adds up to imperialism *end* The Hessian troops were used by England in the
American Revolution in fact the colonial armies fought more Hessian soldiers than English *end* The
House of Hesse-Cassel made a lot of money off the American Revolution *end* Another example of the
Hesse-

Cassel’s ties to the Illuminati is the enigmatic figure St *end* Germain who is hailed as a New Age
Messiah-figure *end* Many researchers believe that St *end* Germain was the son of Francis II of Transylvania *end* Francis II’s second wife was Charlotte Amalie of the House of Hesse he married her in  *end* St *end* Germain was either her son or the prior wife’s this point is debated *end* His name was Leopold-George
and they staged his death in  to save him from the deadly collapse of the Transylvanian dynasty *end* Prince Karl of Hesse Masonic leader of Germany wrote that St *end* Germain had been sent down to Italy
to be raised by the Medici family *end* Later on St *end* Germain appeared out of nowhere to work with the
elite *end* There were questions as to his identity and Napoleon Ill had a dossier gathered on him but the
house holding the dossier was mysteriously destroyed in a fire *end* St *end* Germain was an alchemist and he
claimed to have the alchemical Elixir of Life the secret formula of immortality which the
Rosicrucians also claimed to have *end* He was a guest of William and Karl of Hesse in  and in
 returned to Karl to spend the last years of his known life *end* Helena Blavatsky cofounder of the
Theosophical Society claimed that St *end* Germain was one of the Hidden Masters of Tibet who secretly
controlled the world’s destiny *end* In  Guy Ballard claimed that he met St *end* GermaIn on Mount
Shasta *end* This supposed meeting led to the creation of the ‘I AM’ movement *end*
The Hesse Dynasty has lasted clear up to the  century *end* During WWII they were on Hitler’s side *end* Prince Philip of Hesse was a messenger between Hitler and Mussolini *end* He was still alive in  and
was reported to be the richest prince in Europe *end* The House of Hesse is still a powerful force in
Germany *end* In  Mayer left Hanover to build his fortune in Frankfort *end* His main objective was to
become a financial agent of Prince William of Hesse-Hanau *end* Prince William was an intelligent man
who loved to make money *end* His passions went beyond money *end* His wife did not please him so he
became an adulterer and almost every woman he slept with became pregnant *end* He fathered between
to  illegitimate children *end* His main mistress Frau von Lindenthal bore him  children and ran his
household *end* William loved to loan money at high interest rates *end* He was the perfect man to aid
Mayer’s quest for riches *end* Mayer began bribing Prince William’s servants to become informants *end* At

that time he was an antique dealer trader coin collector and exchanger the country was divided and
as a result the separate currencies made money exchanging very profitable  *end* General von Estorff
convinced Prince William of the value of a rare coin collection and then recommended Rothschild *end* Thus began the relationship between the Prince and the Rothschilds *end* Mayer would sell rare coins
precious stones and antiques to the Prince at ridiculously low prices *end* Then in  after a
significant amount of sales he wrote the Prince asking for and receiving the designation ‘Crown
Agent to the Prince of Hesse-Hanau" a great commercial advertiser *end* Tities and honors were
important in that day they opened doors *end* Mayer then married Gutle Schnapper daughter of a
respected merchant Wolf Salomon Schnapper in  *end* He then set up a money exchange bureau *end* His
two brothers worked in this bureau with him untIl  when Kalmann died and Moses quite *end* Some
researchers contend that Adam Wieshaupt of the Bavarian Illuminati was financially supported by the
Rothschilds *end* The Bavarian Illuminati was founded in  and the Rothschilds were not necessarily
a financial power at that time *end* I may be wrong but I do not believe Mayer was in a financial position
to support Wieshaupt *end* It is possible though that when in  the headquarters of the Illuminati
moved to Frankfort that it began to be controlled by the Rothschilds *end*
In  Prince William’s father Landgrave Frederick of Hesse-Cassel died and William became the
new Landgrave *end* This made him the richest prince in Germany and possibly Europe *end* He left the small
province of Hesse-Hanau to become ruler in Hesse-Cassel *end* Around this time Wolf Schnapper
Mayer’s father-in-law introduced Rothschild to Carl Buderus who was the Prince’s chief financial
advisor *end* Through either coercion friendship or occultic ties Mayer was able to convince Buderus to
become an agent for him *end* This was a big mover for Mayer *end* The Landgrave William of Hesse-Cassel
was to be the ‘steppingstone" to power *end*
Until then Mayer had only done meager business with William but by  Buderus managed to get
some royal bills for Rothschild to discount *end* This wasn’t much but it was a start *end* Carl received a cut of
the profits when he did William’s business through Rothschild *end* This was the beginning of a long
financial relationship that would benefit both parties *end*
Mayer Amschel Bauer-Rothschild was a shrewd man but his quick rise in social status shows the
power of money for Mayer was not cultured *end* He could never master the German language and so he
and his family spoke a strange Yiddish German mixture which benefitted their secret network *end* He
enjoyed

discussing the medieval world and coin collecting *end* When it came to business he was ruthless and
naturally adept *end* His occult side was well hidden *end* He was most likely a Cabalistic Jew *end* Although it is
not known if he was a Freemason he did accompany the Landgrave on several trips to Masonic
lodges after the two had become better friends *end* He had  daughters and  sons plus several children
that died young *end* He moved from his old house the Haus zur Hinterpfann" to a new one Green
Shield when he started making more money *end* Green Shield was a dual residency and the other half
was occupied by the Schiff family who were to play an important role later on as agents of the
Rothschilds *end* Every passage of Green Shield held hidden shelves and cupboards and the backyard
countinghouse’s walls had a number of secret shelves and a secret underground room which was
connected to a neighbor’s house for a quick getaway if necessary the house was built to protect Jews
from the dangerous pogroms that would sweep Germany it was a great place to secretly practice their
gnostic-satanic rituals if they were yet involved in that form of worship *end* His five sons have been
called the Mayer brothers because they all shared that middle name Amschel Mayer Salomon
Mayer Nathan Mayer Kalmann Carl Mayer and Jacob James Mayer *end* Each son entered the family
business at the age of  *end* The humorous side of studying an elite IllumInati family is the

biographer’s insistence on owing the family’s ability to profit from circumstances as "luck.’ They
never seem to put two and two together *end* Many of these circumstances happened by design *end* They
always say things like ‘.. *end* the infant opportunity seemed to be the child of coincidence." They never
attribute a family’s wealth to well planned extortion cheating or thievery which is exactly how
families like the Rothschilds attain their riches *end* The French Revolution is an example *end*
The Illuminati fueled French Revolution got under way in the ’s and Prince William began to
get nervous *end* He was afraid the revolutionary riots would reach Germany and he would lose his gold *end* So he invested his money in a magnificent new palace called Wilhelmshoe which was built from
 to  *end* Although the French Revolution frightened William it was a delight for Mayer *end* The
war helped his sales *end* When the French ended up pitted against the Holy Roman Empire the prices of
imported goods skyrocketed and importing goods from England was a Rothschild specialty *end* In fact
Mayer’s English trade helped him secure a deal with the Landgrave through Buderus of course in
which he became a middleman in England’s payments for the hire of Hessian soldiers *end* ‘...every ill
wind of the ’s seemed to blow good to the Rothschilds." The winds were so good that by the end
of the decade they were established as a rich and independent family *end* In  they were the
richest family in Frankfort’s Jew Alley not counting the wealth in proxy *end* Around the turn of the
century Mayer decIded to send his most clever son Nathan to England to establish another
Rothschild House *end* The family tells a silly story about Nathan leaving for England to best an annoying
English cotton trader but I believe that Nathan was sent by Mayer with a specific purpose - to
establish power with the Rothschild network in that country *end* Nathan arrived in England with no
knowledge of the language but a great amount of money *end* He would soon be the most powerful man in
Europe *end* Many more profitable events occurred at the turn of the century *end* Many of these events
revolve around the Rothschild infiltration of the Thurn and Taxis postal system *end* The House of Thurn
and Taxis was of the Black Nobility *end* In  Holy Roman Emperor Maximilion I of the
Merovinglan bloodline and husband of a member of the Black Nobility

commissioned the House to create a mounted postal service between Vienna and Brussels *end* The
service eventually included all of Central Europe *end* The head office of the system was in Frankfort
which was rather convenient for Mayer who proceeded to do business with them *end* His relationship
with Thurn and Taxis became so close that the service began to inform him of any pertinent
Information found among the letters that they had a habit of covertly reading *end* This mail fraud
system was also used by the Emperor Francis to keep abreast of his enemies *end* While Mayer was
receiving stolen news from Thurn and Taxis he was busy setting up his own postal service so that no-
one could secretly discover his dealings *end* This system was eventually so effective that the Rothschilds
became the best and fastest informed individuals in the world *end* The system was so good that many
prominent men began to send their letters through the Rothschilds who of course always snuck a
peak at the contents *end* The business with Thurn and Taxis helped Mayer receive the title Imperial
Crown Agent" in  *end* This title served as a passport that allowed him to travel throughout the Holy
Roman Empire *end* It also provided the right to bear arms and it freed him from having to pay the taxes
and obligations upon the Jews of that period *end* Mayer began to get even more titles including one from
the German Order of St *end* John *end* His sons Amschel and Salomon were also busy getting various titles *end* In  they became crown agents of the Landgrave William of Hesse-Cassel *end* All these titles were
wonderful but most important was the Landgrave’s *end* The Landgrave was the richest Prince in Europe
and the Rothschilds were determined to take advantage of his wealth *end*
The relationship with the Landgrave improved greatly in  *end* A Danish King and cousin of
William asked the Prince for loans but William declined because he did not want anyone to know
how rich he had become *end* Rothschild learned about it and through Buderus proposed lending the
money anonymously *end* William thought the idea was splendid *end* The loan was sent through Mayer and a
Hamburg Jew *end* The interests were paid to Rothschild who after taking commission forwarded the
money to the Landgrave *end* The event was a great triumph after  years Mayer had finally done a
significant job for the Prince *end* Six more Landgrave loans to Denmark were negotiated by Rothschild *end* Many more loans ensued although they required some teeth pulling on Buderus’ part Including
loans to the Order of St *end* John *end* This negotiating of the Landgrave’s loans greatly increased the
reputation of the House of Rothschild *end* By this time Napoleon had come to power in France *end* This
caused a distress in Europe but brought great profits to the House of Rothschild *end* As one biographer
put it "Napoleon seemed bent on Improving the Rothschild’s lot in life." Even though Napoleon was
not purposely doing It the conditions he created were of great benefit *end* Napoleon tried to get the
Landgrave as his ally but Prince William squirmed and politely as possible refused *end* William’s goal
was to wait untIl the winning side in the Napoleonic conflict was clear so that he could join without

any risks *end* The pressure of the situation gave the Landgrave a very bad temper *end* By this time half the
crown heads of Europe were in his debt *end* Napoleon grew tired of the Landgrave’s games *end* His troops
Invaded Germany and the province of Hesse to "remove the House of Hesse-Cassel from rulership
and to strike It out of the list of powers." Wllhelmshoe became frantic as William attempted to hide
his riches *end* After the scramble to conceal his wealth he fled the province and went to live in exile in
Denmark *end* The French immediately found most of his treasures *end* Buderus and Mayer had to act fast to
preserve the wealth of the Landgrave *end* Some of the valuables had already been sold *end* They quickly
bribed a French General Lagrange who turned over  trunks to Hessian officials and lied to
Napoleon about the Prince’s true wealth *end* Lagrange’s deceptive act was eventually discovered and he
was dismissed but much of the wealth was preserved *end* During the frantic moments before Hesse-
Cassel’s Invasion the Landgrave gave Buderus the right to collect the Interest payments due from
Holy Roman Emperor Francis *end* Buderus eventually transferred this right to the Rothschilds *end* Mayer
began doing the Landgrave’s business behind Napoleon’s back *end* These secret dealings were greatly
boosted by the man Napoleon appointed to rule the area -Karl von Dalberg *end* Dalberg was a friend of
Mayer and Buderns and had done business with them his connection to them may have also been
occult *end* Napoleon made Dalberg Primate of the new Confederation of the Rhine which included
Frankfort *end* As ruler of the region Dalberg protected the Rothschilds from being exposed as traders of
contraband and as agents of the House of Hesse-Cassel *end* When the French cut off trade with England
prices on Imports soared *end* The Rothschilds smuggled goods in and made large profits with Dalberg
keeping guard *end* "It was certainly most remarkable" said one biographer *end* "That the Archbishop and
Lord of the Confederation of the Rhine who ruled over sixteen German princes and stood so high in
Napoleon’s favor should have shown so much good-will to the Jewish Mayer Amschel Rothschild at
Frankfort who although now a rich man had no daim to move in high and influential circles."
Despite Dalberg’s protection Mayer kept two sets of books one inspectable and the other secret *end* By
 Buderus as proxy for the Landgrave was almost exclusively using the Rothschilds for Hesse-
Cassel business *end* Mayer himself would visit the Prince in exile but since he was getting old he soon
had to give up these trips and sent his sons on the journeys *end* The House of Rothschild was collecting
the income of the wealthiest prince in Europe less than half a century after Mayer had begun building
his fortune *end* The satanic House of Rothschild’s IllumInati dealings at this time are well exemplified by
their involvement with the second Tugenbund League *end* The first Tugenbund League or Virtue
League was formed in  as a kind of sex society *end* The group would meet at Henrietta Herz’s
home her husband was an Illuminati Jew who was the disciple of the powerful occultist Moses
Mendelssohn *end* Many Illuminists attended this "Virtue" League *end* A number of young Jewish women
whose husbands were always away on business would come to the Herz’s house to participate in the
immorality two members were daughters of Moses Mendelssohn *end* Frequenters of this ‘salon"
included revolutionary Freemason Mlrabeau William von Humbolt and Frederick von Gentz who
was to become an important Rothschild agent *end* Later on I will discuss Gentz in further detail *end* In
the second Tugenbund League was formed *end* This League pursued ‘moral-scientific" and political
aims *end* The main aim being the deliverance of Germany from French occupation *end* The League was
formed by Baron von Stein who was its principle "protector." Thomas Frost wrote in SECRET
SOCIETIES OF THE EUROPEAN REVOLUTION that ‘The Initiations into the second
Tugendbund multiplied rapidly and the League soon numbered in its ranks most of the Councillors
of State many officers of the army and a considerable number of the professors of literature and
science... *end* A central directorate at Berlin presided over by Stein had the supreme control of the
movement and exercised through provincial committees an authority all the more potent from
emanating from an unknown source and which was obeyed as implicitiy as the decrees of Emperor or
King.’ The Landgrave William of Hesse-Cassel held an important position in the second
Tugendbund *end* Buderus was also involved *end* It appears the Rothschilds were members and they were
go-betweens for the Landgrave’s correspondence on this matter and made payments in favor of
the Tugendbund." This put Mayer Rothschild at the head of the propaganda system against Napoleon *end*
Napoleon tried to suppress Tugundbund but it went underground concealing itself under the
protection of the English Masonic Lodge at Hanover It as sisted many anti-Napoleon causes
physically and financially *end* Tugendbund was eventually dissolved but many of its members moved on
to other Masonic

societies such as the ‘Black Knights’ ‘The Knights of the Queen of Prussia" and ‘The Concordists."
In  the second Tugundbund was revived as the Burschenschaft Association of Boys or Fellows *end* The Burschenschaft was a revolutionary group of students who introduced martial exercises into the
universities *end* The Burschenschaft eventually fell apart *end* After a few years the exiled Landgrave came to
totally trust the Rothschilds *end* ‘...Prince William got more and more accustomed to following Mayer
Rothschild’s advice and scarcely took any important financial step without consulting him.’ This
princely steppingstone was working out perfectly *end* It was paving the way towards Rothschild financial
freedom *end* Mayer wanted to become a creditor and his goal was soon achieved *end* In  the
Rothschild’s firm became ‘Mayer Amschel Rothschild and Sons" Nathan was not a public partner of
this firm *end* That same year Mayer loaned his own money to Denmark and when Dalberg took out a big
loan to go to the baptism of Napoleon’s son the financial security of the Frankfort bank was set in
stone *end*
The House of Rothschild needed a new steppingstone *end* The old one the Landgrave would not be
discarded but they needed a younger more political man who could be their key to controlling
Europe *end* That man was Prince Clemens Metternich who in  became the Austrian Minister for
Foreign Affairs *end* He became the leading opposer of Napoleon and the Landgrave moved in his exile
to Austria hoping the powerful up-start would get Hesse back *end* So the Rothschild network increased
its operations in Austria - the land of the Hapsburgs *end* Around this time Mayer Amschel Bauer-
Rothschild got sick *end* Before his death he wrote a Will that

would dictate the structure of the Rothschilds *end* Although the exact content’s of Mayer’s Will have
been kept secret one edict is clear *end* It completely excluded the daughters and their husbands and heirs
from the business and all knowledge of it *end* The Will totally exalted the importance of the family
circle *end* On Sept *end*   Mayer died *end* A bogus legend about his death maintains that his five sons
gathered around his deathbed and he split Europe between them *end* Only Amschel and Carl were in
Frankfort when he died *end* Nathan was in England and Salomon and James were on the road the
brothers were constantly traveling *end*
THE "FIVE WIZARDS’

When Mayer died headship over the family fell on Nathan Rothschild of England *end* Even though
Nathan was not the oldest the  brothers had voted unanimously that he was the most capable to lead
them *end* Nathan was an intelligent uneducated self-absorbed jerk *end* Though he was an impolite foul-
mouthed man ‘...he could swear like a trooper.’ his money got him into the high society of England *end* His cold view on life and power is seen in his response to an English Major who was being
sentimental about the horrible deaths of the large number of soldiers that had died in the war *end* ‘Well’
said Rothschild *end* ‘If they had not all died Major you presumably would still be a drummer.’ There is
a story that says one of Nathan’s sons asked him how many nations there were in the world and
Nathan replied ‘There are only two you need to bother about *end* There is the mishpoche Yiddish for
family and there are the others.’ This story may be false but the attitude is real *end*
Nathan first settled in Manchester England the center of cloth manufacturing *end* In  he moved to
London *end* As his wealth and his reputation began to grow he was able to marry Hannah Cohen *end* The
Cohens were a wealthy Jewish family from Amsterdam and Hannah’s father Salomon Cohen was a
respected merchant in London *end* Nathan served with him as Warden of the Great Synagogue the
Rothschilds relationship to the Jews will be discussed later on in this article *end* Hannah’s sister Judith
married the powerful Jewish Freemason Moses Montefiore the Montefiore’s were of "ancient" and
extremely ‘aristocratic Jewish stock’ probably another Cabalistic family who was friends with
Nathan Nathan’s sister Henrietta married a Montefiore so did his second son Anthony and his
brother Salomon’s great grandson Aiphonse married a Sebag-Montefiore in  *end* Nathan’s social
life revolved around the Cohens *end* Nathan was a Freemason *end* He was a member of London’s Lodge of
Emulation *end* Nathan’s accumulation of wealth was incredible *end* His money-making exploits were
unbelievable *end* He was smuggling English goods past the French blockade during the Napoleonic
conflict and making great profits *end* This smuggling required an agent in Paris so Mayer through his
Dalberg connections got his son James a passport and James went to live in Paris *end* A large amount of

the Landgrave’s money was sent to Nathan in England on the advice of Buderus for the purpose of
buying stock *end* But Nathan as he and Buderus had planned used the money as capitol for other
ventures *end* When the exiled Landgrave began asking for a proof-of-purchase Buderus and the
Rothschild brothers had to come up with all sorts of excuses to protect Nathan’s thievery *end* Eventually
the Landgrave demanded to see receipts so Nathan quIckly bought some stock the Landgrave had
told him to buy the stocks at  but their price when be ended up buying them was  Nathan
pocketed the savings and they snuck the receipts through the French blockade to the exiled Prince *end* The Landgrave was satisfied he had no idea what had really been done with his money *end* Nathan
began making connections in the British government *end* Probably his greatest early connection was to
the Treasury official John Herries *end* Herries aided Nathan’s rise to power in every way possible *end* He
became an intimate friend or Nathan’s and eventually a proxy for Rothschild in the British
government *end* Their dealings were kept secret and the public had no idea as to the enormity of
Nathan’s power *end* The most incredible example of

Nathan’s devious schemes is a job he would later describe as the best business he had ever done *end* Through Nathan’s connections in the treasury he learned of the plight of the English army in Spain *end* The Duke of Wellington soon to become Nathan’s friend had British troops in Spain ready to attack
France only they lacked one thing - hard cash the army’s financiers would not take paper money
but the government was very short on gold at the time *end* Nathan knew how to profit from this situation *end* The East India Company was trying to sell gold that of coarse the government wanted to buy but the
price was so high that officials decided to wait until it dropped *end* Nathan stepped in and bought up the
gold using some of the Landgraves money as well as his own *end* He then proceed to raise the price *end* When the officials realized the price wouldn’t drop they bought the gold and Nathan made a great
profit *end* But the deal didn’t stop there *end* Nathan offered to deliver the gold to Wellington this was a
heavy responsibility because of the French blockade *end* Hemes went to bat and got Rothschild the job *end* Nathan’s plan was incredible one biographer said his scheme was ‘comparable to burglary in broad
daylight.’ Nathan’s brother James went to Napoleon’s government and told them that Nathan would
be importing gold into France and that the British government was upset at the move because it would
financially hurt England *end* Napoleon’s government believed his lie and any French police who might
have uncovered the plot were bribed *end* So Nathan was able to ship the gold to Paris with the approval
of both the English and French governments *end* In Paris the gold was exchanged in French banking
firms for cash Wellington could use and then the Rothschild network carried the money into Spain as
France allowed Nathan to fund the war against itself *end* Eventually some French officials grew
suspicious but Napoleon ignored their reports why? *end* The plan went smoothly even though the same
officials secretly watched James Rothschild and his brother Carl who was in on the plot *end* Wellington
eventually defeated Napoleon at Waterloo *end* The Wellington smuggle was one of the greatest scams in
history *end* In order to better understand the Rothschild’s involvement in the defeat of Napoleon we must
look at the role played by the Rothschild’s second steppingstone - Metternich *end* Metternich was the
Austrian Minister of Foreign Affairs and he led the opposition against Napoleon *end*
Metternich was a fierce enemy of the revolutionary fires that were spreading through Europe *end* The
Rothschild’s got to him through a member of the first Tugendbund the sexual one Frederick von
Gentz *end* Gentz was Metternich’s right-hand man *end* Metternich was not financially minded and he relied
on Gentz’s advise concerning economics Gentz’s ability to handie his private finances was terrible
but he had a knack for political economy *end* John Herries brought Gentz and the Rothschilds together *end* The family proceeded to bribe the man into their service *end* Gentz is an interesting character *end* He was a
Freemason so he was probably occultic *end* His involvement in the first Tugendbund League points to
Immorality *end* Another interesting fact is that I found most of his visits to the Rothschilds occurred on
occultic

holidays such as Winter Solstice *end* This may be a coincidence but it is interesting non-the-less *end* Gentz
called the Rothschilds ‘a special species plantarum with its own characteristics.’ Gentz steadily
brought Metternich into the Rothschild’s web *end* By at least  Metternich was an ally of the House
of Rothschild *end* His goal was to protect the power of the old aristocracy *end* His plan was simply to
extinguish revolution and he began with Napoleon *end* Austria declared war on France and allied Itself

with Russia *end* England Joined them to form a powerful coalition against Napoleon *end* The battle of
Waterloo in  decided the war *end* Metternich had led Europe to victory with the help of Nathan’s
delivery network which funded the overthrow *end* The victory made Metternich the most powerful man
in Europe *end* Due to his speedy courier system Nathan knew of the outcome of the Waterloo battle
before the news reached any other Englander *end* A persistent myth is that he made the bulk of his
fortune by manipulating the stock exchange with this knowledge *end* First of all he did manipulate the
market but he already had a fortune this only added to It *end* Second of all he might not have even
made a significant profit the issue is complicated and debatable *end* I will not go into it *end* Two years
before his defeat Napoleon had pulled out of Germany *end* In  the Landgrave William of Hesse-
Cassel returned to his province *end* Said one biographer ‘Earlier it had been the Rothschilds who had
asked for favors now it was the Landgrave and Buderus who tried to maintain a close connection.’
In  Buderus died *end* By  Nathan controlled England’s finance *end* He did a large amount of direct
business with the English treasury *end* John Hemes was allowing deals that would hurt England but fill
the pockets of the House of

Rothschild *end* The following quote by one of Nathan’s contemporaries describes his eerie countenance
‘Eyes are usually called windows of the soul *end* But in Rothschild’s case you would conclude that the
windows are false ones or that there was no soul to look out them *end* There comes not one pencil of
light from the interior neither is there any gleam of that which comes from without reflected in any
direction *end* The whole puts you in mind of an empty skin and you wonder why it stands upright
without at least something in it *end* By and by another figure comes up to it *end* It then steps two paces aside
and the most inquisitive glance that you ever saw and a glance more inquisitive than you would have
thought of is drawn out of the fixed and leaden eyes as if one were drawing a sword from a
scabbard...’

This description is disturbingly similar to either MPD or demonic possession *end* A Prussian official said
that Rothschild had ‘an incredible influence upon all financial affairs here in London *end* It is widely
stated .. *end* that he entirely regulates the rate of exchange in the City *end* His power as a banker is
enormous.’ ‘When Nathan .. *end* made a fuss the Bank of England trembled.’ Once he tried to cash a
check from his brother Amschel at the Bank but the Bank refused saying it cashed only its own
notes *end* Nathan’s volcano-like temper exploded *end* The next morning he and nine of his clerks arrived at
the Bank and began exchanging bank notes for gold *end* In one day he had reduced the Bank’s gold
reserves by a substantial amount *end* The next day he and his clerks arrived with more bank notes *end* A
Bank executive nervously asked how long he intended to keep this up *end* Nathan replied something to
the effect of ‘The Bank of England refused to take by bills so I will not keep theirs.’ A meeting was
quickly called and they decided that from then on the Bank of England would be pleased to cash any
Rothschild check Nathan’s firm was named N.M *end* Rothschild and Sons *end* The firm met in the New
Court building and for the sake of brevity will be referred to as New Court *end* New Court was so
powerful that it even became a gold broker for the Bank of England whose price I believe they still
fix at will though I may be wrong *end* He also founded the Alliance Insurance Company in England *end* The Illuminati has the Luciferian belief system that one’s evil acts must be balanced by one’s good
acts *end* This belief system has led to the philanthropy of the truly evil elite although much of this
charity" money goes to fund their objectives *end* Nathan hated the common masses but his duty called *end* ‘Almoners particularly those acting on behalf of the poor Jews of London reported that they got
thousands even hundreds of thousands of pounds out of Rothschild but hardly a word and never a
courtesy.’ Nathan did not enjoy charity *end* He was good friends with Thomas Buxton the anti-slavery
leader *end* The famous musicians Mendelssohn and Rossini taught his daughter to play the harp *end* When
Mayer died in  his oldest son Amschel took over the Frankfort firm *end* Although Amschel was not
the head of the family he was its spokesman to the aristocracy *end* He was the one who would apply for
the honors and titles for his brothers *end* He has been described as a crotchety worrier who clung to the
past *end* He was socially odd yet held great dinners that were the talk of the elite *end* Religion was a big part
of his life to the point of being called monkish." Even though he lived on a grand scale Amschel
had no joy *end* Much of this distress came from the fact that he had failed to have any children *end* After
Napoleon exited Germany a German Confederation was set up of which Amschel became the
treasurer *end* In a sense this made him the first finance minister of the Prussian Empire which was

created by the Confederation *end* Amschel’s sorrow over his lack of children led him to pick prominent
young men to treat as his sons *end* One such man was Otto von Bismark who would later become the
Iron Chancellor of Germany *end* Amschel was the protector of his mother Gutle who was the Matriarch
of the family *end* No one could receive full admission into the House of Rothschild by marriage unless
she approved *end* Gutie smiled little and had a harsh tongue *end* One legend has it that a neighbor asked her
whether there was to be peace or war *end* War?" Gutle replied *end* "Nonsense *end* My boys won’t let them."

Saloman was the second oldest son of Mayer *end* Along with the other brothers he was constantly
travelling through Europe *end* What separated him from his brothers was his gift of diplomacy *end* He was
more stately and complimentary than the others *end* Said one banker of Salomon "Nobody leaves him
without being comforted." in other words he knew how to kiss up *end* It was this fact that led the brothers
to send him to Vienna Austria to establish a relationship with the painfully aristocratic Hapsburgs
and with vain Metternich *end* Although the Rothschilds had attempted to enter a close business
relationship with the Hapsburgs and Austria the Austrian royalty kept putting them off *end* Then
Salomon came along *end* He rode in on a wave of new found Rothschild power *end* Their name had become
famous *end* One person described it as the "two magic syllables." The brothers had become as one
biographer put it "the Archdemons of Progress." Salomon began to vie for Austrian ties through
Gentz and Metternich *end* Eventually Salomon’s diplomacy Metternich’s lobbying and the below-cost
method earlier used on the Landgrave broke down the wall between the House of Rothschild and the
Illuminati Hapsburgs *end* Austria began to employ the Rothschilds on a regular basis *end* Salomon moved
into Vienna and bought a Hotel and a house *end* Salomon knew how to play Metternich like a piano *end* He
knew the right thing to say at the right time *end* He knew Metternich’s quirks and prejudices such as his
vanity which Salomon easily manipulated *end* Pretty soon Metternich and Salomon became close friends *end* The same goes for Metternich’s right-hand man Gentz *end* Gentz and Salomon were "inseparable."
Salomon was also a Freemason *end* It came to the point where Austria became so controlled by the
Rothschilds that the government did not want to refuse the brothers anything *end* In  Amschel
Salomon Carl and James received a title of nobility from the Hapsburgs *end*
In  the Aix-la-Chapelle Congress met to discuss the future of Europe *end* Salomon Carl Metternich
and Gentz all attended this Congress *end* It was here that Metternich first met the Rothschilds *end* Gentz kept
the minutes of the Congress he was called the "Secretary of Europe." A Rothschild scheme at this
Congress totally shook the financial institutions of Europe there was no denying the power of the
Rothschilds *end* "The divine right of kings had been overthrown by the divine right of money.." At Aix-
la-Chapelle the Rothschilds widened their circle of influence in the Illuminati *end* Salomon set up a new
firm in Vienna *end* He financially supported Metternich’s fight against revolution *end* Metternich had
established the "Vienna System" which controlled Europe after Napoleon’s defeat *end* The Austrian
leader began doing what the elite love to do - sending "peacekeeping" troops Into conflIcts *end* -
 has been described as "The Age of Metternich" but since the Rothschilds financed and
controlled him it would be more accurate to call it "The Age of the House of Rothschild." The Order
of Vladimir was conferred upon Salomon for his work with Russia *end* Gioacchino Rossini the Italian
opera composer who wrote Cinderella and the William Tell overture became a good friend of both
Salomon and his brother James *end* In  he Metternich Gentz James and Cari attended the Verona
Congress *end* This Congress was totally manipulated by the Rothschilds *end* They profited Immensely by its
outcome *end* Salomon financed the first important Central European railways *end* The Austrians began
saying that they had an Emperor Ferdinand and a King Salomon *end* When it came to Austrian finances
Salomon got the last word *end* The people would show up at his office and beg for a royal "laying on of
hands." He only had to touch a bond or a stock and its owner went away certain of its rise *end* Uke the
other Rothschilds he gave immense charity donations *end* He bought the huge coal and iron works of
Vitkovitz *end* In  he received permission to purchase inheritable agricultural real estate many
people were against Jews buying private property and he proceeded to buy up large amounts of land *end* He obtained the lease of Austria’s mercury mines *end* This and the only other mercury deposit in Spain
were controlled by the Rothschilds creating a world monopoly on a key metal *end* Salomon was
incredibly powerful *end*
The next son Cart was the family’s chief courier *end* He was the least intelligent of all the brothers *end* He
was awkward when he spoke and he had a nasty temper *end* One biographer described him as "punchy" *end* In  Carl was sent to Naples Italy to oversee loans there that were meant to finance Metternich’s
forces who had arrived to quell a rebellion *end* While in Italy the Rothschild "mantle" came upon Carl
and he made a series of ingenious deals with the Italian government that forced Naples to pay for its
own occupation *end* He also helped Luigi de Medici of the Black Nobility to re-gain his position as
finance minister of Naples and later did business with the powerful man *end* Due to his success it was
decided that he would stay in Naples and set up his own bank *end* He became financier to the court the
"financial overiord of Italy." Carl "...wound the Italian peninsula around his hand." He did business
with the Vatican and when Pope Gregory XVI received him by giving him his hand rather than the
customary toe to kiss people realized the extent of his power *end* The Pope conferred upon him the
Order of St *end* George *end*
It appears that in Italy Carl became a leader of Carbonarism *end* After the Bavarian IllumInati was
exposed Carbonarism or the Alta Vendita became the major European occult power *end* Carl’s
leadership in this group is very significant *end* In  a secret Alta Vendita document that Cari had
participated in preparing was sent to the headquarters of Masonry *end* A copy of this document was lost
and the Masons got very upset and offered rewards for the return of this copy *end* The title of the
document translates "Permanent Instructions or Practical Code of Rules; Guide for the Heads of the
Highest Grades of Freemasonry *end* "

Last but absolutely not least was the youngest son James *end* During the Napoleonic conflict James had
spent his time between London and Paris supporting the Rothschild’s network of illegal trade with
England *end* After the Wellington smuggle and the defeat of Napoleon James became an established
figure in France *end* He founded a bank there and began the French branch of the Rothschild family *end* James was a  degree Scottish Rite Mason *end* At this time the French House

was the center of operations for the Rothschilds *end* Even though successive revolutions would de-throne
ruler after ruler Rothschild power kept the family in control *end* James was good friends with the leading
minister of the Bourbon court Count de Villele and he "owned" King Louis Philippe *end* He also
secretly funded Spanish revolutionaries his agent in Madrid was Monsieur Belin *end* James yearned for
social status *end* The pursuit of which was second only to money *end* He had gown so powerful that the
French exchange was deeply affected by all his decisions *end* Like his brother Salomon he pioneered
the railroad business in France *end* He also bought the great Lafite vineyards *end* His bank de Rothschild
Freres was in a league all its own *end* No one in France could even wish to be as powerful as James *end* As
Salomon had James received the Order of Vladimir for his work with the Russian dynasty *end* He also
became a member of the Societe de Antiquites *end* In the Rothschild tradition as

constituted by Mayer’s Will of trying to keep everything within the family James married his niece
Betty Rothschild the daughter of Salomon *end* The Rothschilds main advantage was their incredible
courier system *end* It kept the  Houses connected *end* In fact the Hapsburgs used this system quite often *end* All evidence points to the Rothschild brothers being very powerful within Freemasonry *end* They were
one of the leading families in occultism at that time in Europe *end* Many prominent Masons of their day
praised the brothers *end* In  due to Metternich’s lobbying Nathan was made Austrian consul in
London and two years later he was made consul-general *end* James was also made an Austrian consul in
Paris *end* Metternich’s promptings also provided something else very important to the family; in  all
the brothers

and their descendants of either sex were made Barons *end* This established social position for the
Rothschilds *end* The Gentz-Metternich team was very beneficial to the House of Rothschild *end* By this time
a few papers had run some upsetting articles about the family *end* Salomon asked Gentz to censure any
more unkind reports and he also commissioned the Illuminist to write a bogus biography on the
family that would portray them in a good light *end* Gentz now called the "Pen of Europe" proceeded to
write legends for the Rothschilds and the family fully encouraged the propaganda in their social
circles *end* The brothers had a system based on Mayer’s Will where only family members were partners
or owners of the banks *end* This system is still in use today *end* The Rothschild banks bought everything up

from mining corporations to national debts *end* For instance New Court has been controlling Brazil’s
debts since  *end* In  Nathan Rothschild head of the House of Rothschild died he may have
been poisoned *end* The headship was passed on to his younger brother James by a vote of all the
brothers *end* In  the signs of masonic-fueled revolution began to appear again *end* Metternich’s "peace
of the world" they always call imperialism peace" was being threatened *end* A new king was set up in
France the House of Orange was dethroned in the Netherlands *end* The fires of revolution were
spreading through the masonic network and Metternich began to lose his grip on Europe *end*
The Revolution of  in France de-throned yet another royal house *end* James went along with the
masonic agenda and financed this revolution even though he was a friend of the court *end* The revolution
marked the end of Metternich’s "Age" and that same year insurrectors chased him and Salomon out
of Austria *end* Neither returned but a Vienna House had already been established others would carry it
on under the direction of Salomon’s son Anselm *end* Metternich’s descendants are still close to the
House of Rothschild *end* After this the power of the Rothschilds weakened *end* By  all five brothers
were dead except James *end* Napoleon III was now in power in France and his advisors were the enemies
of James *end* But Rothschild ingenuity came through again when James got Napoleon Ill to marry a
Rothschild agent *end* James died in I  and the family headship went to Alphonse his son *end*
"THE NEW TRINITY"

Three cousins now ran the show - Alphonse of the French House Uonel of the English House and
Anselm of the Vienna House - "the new trinity" *end* The three banned together to destroy an enemy bank
French Credit Mobilier *end* Anselm set up a new firm Creditanstalt in Vienna to combat the French
bank *end* With the help of Lionel and Alphonse he attacked Credit Mobilier until it collapsed *end* The new
head of the House of Rothschild was Baron Alphonse de Rothschild *end* Alphonse was a suave socially
elite man *end* After the rail of France’s Credit Mobilier Napoleon ill stepped onto the Rothschild
bandwagon *end* Alphonse was powerful he had "access" to men like Napoleon III and Bismark of
Prussia *end* The Illuminati decided to get rid of Napoleon Ill so English Prime Minister Gladstone
friend of the Rothschilds set things up so that Prussia and France would go to war *end* Napoleon ill
proceeded to attack Prussia and Bismark responded in a furry defeating France and banishing
Napoleon III from the throne *end* The war indemnities were paid to Bismark who had a dislike for
Alphonse despite his connections to the family through the Rothschilds *end* Alphonse’s brother
Edmond was the one who helped create Israel this will be discussed further on in the article *end* Alphonse married another

Rothschild but his love for her was not very strong *end* The Comtesse de Castiglione was a beautiful
woman who was a Marylin Monroe of her day *end* She was the mistress of Alphonse his brother Gustave
Rothschild whose daughter married a Sassoon and Napoleon III *end* Anselm Rothschild of the Vienna

described as "grouchy" and "crotchety." In  Lionel became the first Jew in House of Commons *end* After eleven tries the British Parliament gave in and allowed Rothschild to take his seat *end* Not a single
significant political move by Lionel was recorded during his stay in Parliament *end* He was a member for
 years *end* in  he died *end* After Amschel of the House of Frankfort died without an heir two of Carl
of Italy’s sons came to take over the business *end* But they also remained heirless bearing only
daughters *end* When the last brother died in  the Frankfort bank was liquidated I believe they did
not try to continue the original bank because they knew that Germany was about to be caught up in
the turmoil of the world wars they eventually set up another Frankfort bank after Germany’s
turmoil *end*
The House of Italy ended the same way *end* The one son of Carl who had stayed in Naples produced only
daughters and when Geribaldi’s Red Shirts unified Italy this remaining son out of character for a
Rothschild chose not to accommodate the new powers and moved to France *end* Thus ended the Italian
branch *end*
ROTHSCHILD INFLUENCE IN AMERICA

This subject is so massive that it will only be touched on *end* In  August Belmont came to the U.S *end* during the Panic of  *end* August Belmont appears to have been a Rothschild proxy *end* Belmont bought
up government bonds in this Panic and his success eventually led him to the White House where he
became the "financial advisor to the President of the United States" *end* His policies helped pit the North
against the South for the Civil War *end* Judah P *end* Benjamin who according to A *end* Ralph Epperson was the

one of the main Illuminati figures to control America during the early  Century *end*
Some of the Bauer line of the Rothschild family moved to America and took up Important positions
in the hierarchy’s network *end*
THE HOUSE OF ROTHSCHILD AND ISRAEL

The Rothschild relationship to the Jews is deceiving *end* The family stance is publicized as "pro-Jewish"
and they have given abundant charity to Jewish causes *end* But their support of the Jewish race has in
most cases been used for the sole purpose of controlling the direction and profiting from the Jews *end* The Rothschilds have been described as the royal family of the Jews *end* Many leading Rothschilds have
been dubbed "King of the Jews" *end* But what kind of Judaism do the Rothschilds support *end* Do they
support the orthodox Jews who believe in the Old Testament and are waiting for the return of the
messiah *end* No *end* Do they support Messianic Jews who believe Jesus Christ was the messiah who came to
save all men *end* No *end* The Rothschilds support those Jews who have fallen prey to the deceptive gnostic
and occultic teachings of Cabalism and in turn support the Illuminati controlled Zionist movement *end* Not all Zionists are part of the conspiracy but their leaders are and the ultimate leaders of the
Zionists have been the Rothschilds *end* I am disappointed by some researchers who automatically coin
the conspiracy a Jewish" one *end* This unfortunate stumbling block has polluted their work making it
just as misleading as the information put out by the popular media *end* These researchers seem blinded by
the fact that the conspiracy has abused and manipulated the Jewish race more than any other group in
the history of the world *end* The hierarchy of the Jews has sat back and allowed the attack on and control
of the Jewish masses for the furtherance of Satan’s agenda *end* I am saying this to let you see that I am
not anti-semitic *end* I believe that there are people who call themselves "Christians" who are part of the
conspiracy at the same token there are people who call themselves "Jews" who are part of the
conspiracy *end* To call the conspiracy "Jewish" is ignorant *end* I believe the Rothschilds to have been
involved in Cabalism Jewish Sabbatism or Frankism all of which

are involved in witchcraft *end* This belief is strengthened by the Rothschild’s use of the occultic Seal of
Solomon as a family symbol *end* The city in which the Rothschilds originated Frankfort was deeply
anti-Semitic *end* The Rothschilds were constantly striving to overcome the boundaries put on them
because of their culture *end* It is very likely this berthed a bitterness in their hearts towards "Christian"

society *end* This bitterness and the need to facilitate more profit and power were most likely the reasons
why they excepted the idea of a Jewish state *end* I will assume that the readers understand that the
Zionism / restoration of Israel concept is an unbiblical sham *end*
The following quote will help you understand the Rothschild attitude towards the Jews *end* .. *end* the first
principle of the House of Rothschild was to amass wealth and the liberation of the Jewish race
from oppressive restrictions contributed Indirectly to this end since it would facilitate intercourse
with the rest of the world and thereby increase the possibility of financial gain which in turn would
serve to increase its power." The Rise of The House of Rothschild by Count Egon Corti p *end* -
Amschel of the Frankfort House was constantly harassed by anti-semites *end* As a result "He became the
grand almoner and grand protector to the German Jews; he helped sweep away the chains of Jew
Street; he pressed in the end successfully for the Jews’ enfranchisement as free citizens of
Frankfort." One of the main Rothschild agents used to promote the emancipation of the Jews in
Frankfort was Frederick von Gentz the evil "Pen of Europe" *end* At this point I must clarify something
for the reader *end* There are  Baron Edmond Rothschilds and all  have been involved with the nation
of Israel *end* To avoid confusion I will number them

# Baron Edmond de Rothschild -- House of France *end* Son of James and brother of
Alphonse *end*
# Baron Edmund "Eddie" L de Rothschild - -  House of England *end* Son of Uonei Nathan and
great great grandson of the infamous Nathan Rothschild *end*
# Baron Edmond de Rothschild - *end*  House of France *end* Son of Maurice and grandson of #
Edmond *end*
The story begins with # Edmond the "Father of Israel" *end* During the Crimean War which was funded
by the Rothschilds the small Jewish community in Jerusalem became cut off from all outside
support *end* This resulted in "semi-starvation" *end* # Edmond’s father James set up the James Mayer de
Rothschild Hospital in Jerusalem in response to this problem *end* # Edmond picked up his fathers
interest in Palestine *end* When the Russian Jews fled the Czar’s pogroms in the ’s Edmond began to
finance the Russian Jew’s attempts to establish colonies in Palestine It is clear that # Edmond was a
fan of Zionism his charities were not only aiding the persecuted but were promoting the concept of a
return the "homeland" *end* "The Baron’s money drained swamps dug wells and built houses *end* It founded
industries ranging from scent factories to glass works form wine cellars to bottle manufacturers *end* The
Baron established his own administration in Palestine and his overseers dictated to the farmers
exactly what crops were to be grown and where." The man who set up the first Zionist Congress was
Theodor Herzl *end* He attempted to get the support for his plans to "restore the Jewish state" from the
Rothschilds but many members of the family were opposed to Zionism the Rothschilds supported
those causes which they could profit from and the Integration of Jews into the European culture was
profitable for them *end* One Rothschild told Herzl he was an Englishman and proposed to remain one *end* #
Edmond on the other hand *end* was leading a Rothschild plan similar to Herzl’s that slowly created a
Jewish state controlled by the family *end* # Edmond did not oppose Zionism in fact he supported
Herzl’s cause yet he felt Herzl’s plans should not be implemented so soon they were "to be
accomplished quietly stealthily not by shouting from the roof-tops" plus he was concerned that
Herzl would take away too much Rothschild power over the slowly forming Jewish state *end* The Baron
continued to support his own colonies and though Herzl was socially supported because his Ideas
facilitated Rothschild power in Palestine he was not allowed to implement his plans *end* # Edmond did
not want Herzl in control *end* Later after Herzl had died and was no longer a threat # Edmond
"admitted" that Herzl had been right and went right on pouring money into the Jewish "Homeland" *end* # Edmond had a tight-fisted control of the colonies *end* .. *end* the Baron was a dictator who expected the
colonists to obey him unquestionably." In  the Jews in Palestine sent a delegation to the Baron
who told him .. *end* if you wish to save the Yishuv the - Jewish settlement first take your hands
from It and .. *end* for once permit the colonists to have the possibility of correcting for themselves
whatever needs correcting ..." This upset the Baron *end* He replied "I created the Yishuv I alone *end* Therefore no men neither colonists nor organizations have the right to interfere in my plans." Herzl

was succeeded as President of World Zionism by David Wolffsohn *end* Wolffsohn got the full support of
the Baron *end* Wolffsohn’s successor was Otto Warburg *end* Another prominent leader of the Zionists was
Chalm Weizmann *end* Weizmann was on better terms with # Edmond than his predecessor Herzl *end* He
made this observation of the Baron after their first visit *end* "In manner be could be both gracious and
brutal; and this was the reflex of his split personality; for on the one hand he was conscious of his
power and arrogant in the possession of it; on the other hand he was rather frightened by it and this
gave him a touch of furtiveness." The Baron Rothschild told Weizmann be would finance a Hebrew
University in Palestine *end* With Weizmann’s appearance on the scene the Baron became closer to
Zionism *end*
In  # Edmond traveled to Palestine *end* "Edmond could scarcely believe his eyes *end* Tel Aviv had
become a city and his miserable windswept colonies had been transformed into lush gardens..." His
journey to Palestine was hailed as the "prince returning to his people" *end* Later the Baron Rothschild
told Weizmann "Without me Zionism would not have succeeded but without Zionism my work
would have been struck to death." Another Rothschild embraced Zionism through Weizmann - Lionel
Walter the second Lord Rothschild apparently this upset some relations *end* The Balfour declaration
which declared England’s support of the creation of a Jewish homeland was addressed to Lord
Rothschild II *end* Lord Rothschild also received the documents of support from the League of Nations *end* Charles T *end* Russell sent a letter to Lord Rothschild that praised him for his work towards a Jewish
homeland *end* After World War I Britain ruled Palestine and the Rothschilds ruled Britain *end* Also a bulk
of unpaid debts to the Rothschilds by the failed Ottoman Empire gave the family more control over
Palestine *end* Then came Hitler *end* According

to Walter Langer a psychoanalyst who wrote the book THE MIND OF ADOLF HITLER the
demonic German leader was a grandson of a Rothschild *end* Adolf’s father AIls Hitler was the
illegitimate son of Maria Anna Schicklgruber *end* It was generally supposed that the father of Alols
Hitler was Johann Georg Hiedler... *end*
"There are some people who seriously doubt that Johann Georg Hiedler was the father of Alois... *end* an
Austrian document was supposedly prepared that proved Maria Anna Schicklgruber was living in
Vienna at the time she conceived *end* "At that time she was employed as a servant in the home of a
Baron Rothschild *end* As soon as the family discovered her pregnancy she was sent back to her home .. *end* where Alois was born." It is believed that Hitler who was totally created by Satan’s Empire attacked
Austria first in order to destroy the Austrian records that proved his Jewish ancestry *end* As Hitler’s
demonic attack on the Jews progressed one would imagine that the Zionists would come to the rescue
and offer Palestine as a safe haven *end* Not so *end* Many European countries shut their doors to the Jews
including the Palestine colonies *end* The Zionist controlled immigration laws in Palestine were very strict
and it was near impossible to escape to the Jewish homeland *end* In fact the ZIonists refused to admit
there was a Holocaust going on although evidence points to them knowing *end* I suppose in their minds it
was ok to sacrifice a great number of Jewish lives in order to promote the idea of a Jewish state *end* To
the elite the Holocaust was like shooting dead a herd of cattle to receive the insurance payment *end* Said
Michael Seizer in his book *end* ZIONISM RECONSIDERED "Not even the events of  aroused their
Zionism’s political interest *end* They were naive enough to see them as a God-sent opportunity for an
undreamt of wave of immigration to Palestine *end* When the Zionist Organization against the natural
impulses of the whole Jewish people decided to do business with Hider to trade German goods
against the wealth of German Jewry to flood the Palestine market with German products and thus
make a mockery of the boycott against German-made articles they found llttle opposition in the
Jewish National Homeland and least of all among its aristocracy - the so-called Kibutniks." Hitler
forced the Jews to wear the six-pointed star as a sign of shame *end* It was this same symbol that the
Rothschilds were named after and the same symbol that the Zionists promoted as a symbol of Jewish
national identity *end* Do you see the contradiction *end* Said Jewish author OJ *end* Graham in THE SIX-
POINTED STAR "Not all the concentration camp victims were Jewish people *end* Many were
Christians *end* Spiritually a parallel can be seen in the rituals to Ashteroth and Moloch where the
victims were burned as sacrifices to these false gods *end* Were the victims of the Nazis someone’s
sacrificial offerings?" I believe they were *end* Remember the six-pointed star was the symbol of Moloch

and Ashteroth *end* Unfortunately few Jews will tolerate a discussion of this subject *end* After World War II
the U.N *end* spurred on by the IllumInati created horrors against the Jews panted Israel its statehood *end* Weizmann was the first president of Israel’s Knesset which was built with Rothschild money *end* The
occultic hexagram is on the Knesset and is also displayed on the Jewish flag *end* "...the six-pointed star
had made its way from Egyptian pagan rituals of worship to the goddess Ashteroth and Moloch to
King Solomon when he went into idolatry" say Graham *end* "Then it progressed through the magic arts
witchcraft including Arab magicians Druids witches and Satanists astrology in which It was no
new thing through the Cabala to Isaac Luria a Cabalist in the  century to Mayer Amschel
Bauer who changed his name to this symbol to Zionism to the Knesset of the new State of Israel to
the flag of Israel and Its medical organization equivalent to the Red Cross." What is the ultimate goal
of Zionism *end* David Ben-Gurion a Zionist leader tells us "Weth the exception of the U.S.S.R *end* as a
federated Eurasian state all other continents will become united in a world alliance at whose disposal
will be an International police force *end* All armies will be abolished and there will be no more wars *end* In
Jerusalem the United Nations a truly United Nations will build a Shrine of the Prophets to serve thi
federated union of all continents; this will be the seat of the Supreme Court of Mankind to settle all
controversies among the federated continents." Simply stated Zionism with Rothschild support
promotes a New World Order *end* The Rothschild control of Israel is Immense *end* # Edmond established
Trusts that make massive donations to Israel *end* Biographer Virginia Cowles explains "Originally the
principle Trust was known as Pica - Palestine Jewish Colonization Association - but when it became
clear after the establishment of the State of Israel that colonization would be handled by the
Government Its functions were changed *end* Edmond’s son James renamed it Hanadiv’ the Hebrew
word for ‘benefactor’ by which his father was known throughout Palestine; and at the same time
rechannelled the Trust’s funds to the promotion of education science and culture *end* When James died
in  his widow Dollie assumed the presidency which she still holds *end* For many years she has been
powerfully assisted by Lord Victor Rothschild and recently she has enlisted the help of the latter’s
son Lord Jacob *end* The Trust knows no boundaries *end* In the s it carried out James’ wishes by
providing money for the Knesset the new Parliament building in Jerusalem *end* Today its beneficiaries
range from universities hospitals and public libraries to archaeological digs; from the board of the
Weizmann Scientific Institute to the organizers of Instructional Television."

# Edmund is the most "race-conscious" of all the Rothschilds *end* He is on the board of many Jewish
philanthropies - including president of the Association of Jewish Ex-Servicemen and Women joint
treasurer of the Council of Christians and Jews and treasurer of the Friends of the Hebrew University
of Jerusalem *end* In  he sent a letter to THE TIMES magazine suggssting Great Britain Russia and
the U.S *end* all chip in and build de-salinization plants for Israel so that the desert could be turned into a
lush garden with plenty of food and nothing to fight over I have found that # Edmund loves to
come up with cock-a-maime scientific suggestions towards the solution of world problems *end* For
example in an address to the organizers of the U.N.’s Earth Summit he suggested building massive
dry-ice machines on the polar capes to prevent their melting in the face of global warming *end* #
Edmund is also a warden of the Great Synagogue in London *end* He is the senior member of New Court
in London and is a member of the Illuminati’s Pilgrim Society *end* # Edmond is an entrepreneur *end* He is
very involved in tourism and has funded many luxury resorts in Israel *end* He controls Compagnie
Financlere which is his holding company in France *end* He owns Banque Privee in Switzerland and a
merchant bank in Paris *end* He controls the largest toy company and the largest frozen food company in
France *end* He is a director of Belgium’s Banque Lambert and of DeBeers Consolidated Mines in South
Africa *end* He is on the Steering Committee of the Bilderbergers *end* And his interests extend into Israel
where he is the chairman of Tri-Continental Pipelines *end* Chairman of the Israel Corporation and
chairman of Isrop which controls the Israel General Bank *end* The list continues *end* # Edmond is on the
board of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem *end* He directs the Middle East Peace Institute which he
founded in  *end* He regularly donates money to the Biological-Physio-Chemical Institute which was
founded by his grandfather # Edmond *end* Hesits on the boards ofa dozen or so hospitals and scientific
institutes *end* # Edmond is considered the richest Rothschild *end* He has massive power and this includes
control of much of Israel *end* The Rothschilds have even had a street named in their honor *end* The First
International Bank of Israel is located at  Rothschild Boulevard in Tel Aviv *end* Bank Hapoalim
"Israel’s fastest growing bank" is next door at  Rothschild Boulevard *end* The satanic Rothschilds

simply dominate Israel *end* Apparently Israel has served as the meeting grounds for the French and
English Rothschilds *end* The French and English Houses contributed over  million to Israel around the
time of the Six-Day War *end* It is reported that when Baron Alain of the French House visited Israel he
"burst into tears" at the sight of the walling wall *end* Baroness Alix of the French House is the World
President of Youth Aliyah which deals with the emigration of Jewish children to Israel *end* Evelyn of the
English House is chairman of the Board of Governors of the Technion Israel’s Institute of
Technology *end* The satanic Rothschilds simply dominate Israel *end* The Rothschilds help Satan’s Empire
control the world’s resources the world’s nations and the world’s religions *end* They are an institution in
the conspiracy and if one looks carefully the path of their destructive reign can be followed through
the history of the past  centuries *end*
This article will be continued in the next newsletter where It will discuss the House of Rothschild in
the  century *end*

INTRODUCTION TO PART  OF THE ROTHSCHILDS

by Fritz Springmeier

Lenin said that the establishment of a central bank was % of communizing a nation Lenin himself
and Trotsky were required to place MI operatives in key positions during the Russian Revolution *end* and these operatives were in turn controlled by the Satanic elite back in London England *end* It is no
secret that the Rothschilds play a major rode in International Bankers and that various Rothschilds
like Lord Victor Rothschild have played major roles in MI *end* I mentIon these two items to drIve home
what should be an obvious condusion the Rothschilds are major players in the control of the world
and the New World Order *end*
There is so much activity on the part of the modern-day Rothschilds that the controlled news media’s
censorship which protects the Rothschilds have not been able to screen out everything there are stIll
tidbits here and there that filter through the controlled media’s censorship *end* Still my search continues
for descendants of the Rothschilds who are willing to expose what the Rothschilds are all about *end* I
have found a few *end* One who I have not had the opportunity to interview yet is the husband of Rebecca
Brown *end* It is reported that Rebecca Brown’s husband was an Illuminatus of the Rothschild bloodlIne
and that he escaped them and has been attemptIng to do some exposure of their Satanic practices *end* According to what I have been told they wanted to skin him alive *end* I have unfortunately not been able
to interview Rebecca Brown Yoder’s husband who has been called by the Lord to strengthen the end
time church *end*
THEIR POWER IS EXTENSIVE

Peter Rupert Lord Carrington who is the chairman of the Bilderbergers *end* has been the Rothschild’s
director of their Rio Tinto Zinc Corp *end* He also is director of Barclay’s Bank and part of the Trilateral
Commission *end* Francois Mitterand who has led France is an extremely close friend of the Rothschilds *end* I point these two men out just to portray to the reader the extensive power the Rothschilds wield
behind the scenes *end* WHAT THEY CALL THEIR BLOODUNE IN THE ILLUMINATI

During IlluminatI ceremonies when candidates are presented for approval at the Sisters of Ught and
the Mothers of Darkness levels the bloodline of the Rothschilds is actually called the Rothschild
bloodline." Although It was orIginally went by the name Bauer and many of the descendants today
continue to be Bauers and Bowers the name Rothschild" was the occult name that the Bauers
personally chose for their bloodline to be POWER BROKER IN LATIN AMERICA

One of my friends from South America got to personally witness the destruction of South America by
Rothschild interests *end* One item that I am familiar with from history and which I can’t help thinking
about is how the nation of Bolivia in  had the fine distinction of having absolutely no foreign
debt *end* However in  the Morgans of America loaned Bolivia money and in  Chandler & Co *end* loaned them  *end* millIon *end* Thus began the plunge of a free nation Into economic slavery to the
Illuminati’s international Bankers *end* The point is that nations like Bolivia if left alone would have been
far better off *end* People don’t realize that the problems these "banana republics" have is to a large degree
beIng cause by powerful outsiders lIke the Rothschilds *end* who then direct organizations like the IMF to
save" these poor nations *end* When the Rothschilds set themselves up in Brazil they set up to be there
permanently *end* They came in during the  century *end* The Rothschilds and other british Interests
played a major role in Brazil’s railway system which became a law unto itself *end* Just as the secret
history of the railway tycoons reveals a great deal about the secret elite in the United States so it also
does in Brazil *end* Later Henry Kaiser and Nelson Rockefeller moved into South America incl *end* Brazil to
promote their capitalistic visIons *end* They promoted the light industrialization of LatIn America and its
economic interdependence in the ’s and ’s *end* The Scroll & Key Society is one of the
illuminati’s secret entry points at Yale University *end* The Scroll and Key Society financed a book by
Elizabeth A *end* Cobbs entitled The Rich Neighbor Policy Rockefeller and Kaiser in Brazil *end* This book
Yale Univ *end*  p *end*  states that Brazilians have looked to Rockefeller as their connection to the
United States *end* Other elite families besides the Rothschilds have also substantial Latin American
economic control such as the DuPonts *end*
THE BLOODUNES ARE SECRET

One of the principle points that should be borne in mind is that the actual occult power of the
Rothschild bloodlIne is hidden in secret lineages *end* Although the Rothschilds make up part of the
Rothschild bloodline people should also watch out for names such as Bauer Bowers Sassoons and
many other last names *end* People within the illuminati who have Rothschild blood are aware of their
secret ancestry but outsiders in the world are more often than not are never going to be told that they
carry such powerful" occult blood *end*


ABOVE THE LAW

The story of what happened to BankCal which was the oldest bank in California illustrates how
powerful the Rothschilds are in the United States *end* The details of this story come from the San Jose
Calif Mercury News Jan *end*  *end*  *end* I was somewhat surprised that the article appeared considering
the strength of the Rothschilds *end* Sometimes corruption at the top stinks so bad that It can’t be
suppressed entirely *end* The United States has the Securities Exchange Commission SEC in place to
protect the American public from stock fraud *end* During the ’s there were  highly publicized cases
of fraud that the SEC uncovered *end* These three cases created widespread confidence within the
american public that stock market trading was in general honestly traded *end* The story of what Edmond
Rothschild full name is Edmond Adolphe Jules Jacques Maurice Baron de Rothschild did with
BankCal expose to the world that men like the Rothschilds do not have to play by the same rules as

everyone else *end* They are literally above the law *end* The powerful Illuminati control the law *end* In  the
CEO of BankCal De Bretteville sold Edmond Rothschild  shares of Bancal Tristate Corp *end* % of the holding company for the Bank of California *end* De Bretteville had originally asked two
English Rothschild cousins if they wanted to purchase the stock *end* These two cousins then called two
French Rothschild cousins who then called Edmond in Geneva Switzerland for assistance *end* Edmond
told them he would help them buy it and that after he purchased it *end* he would turn around and divide
it with his relatives *end* He lied *end* And over the next few years he would continue to lie to numerous
people about his intents for the bank *end* De Bretteville says "He lied to his family and he lied to me it
was a dirty deal all around." Bank of California had the only banking franchise at the time which was
in all three Pacific rim states OR WA CA *end* It turned out that the Bank of California was like a piece
of art to Rothschild *end* He had no Intention of improving the bank he simply wanted it for his collection
of companies *end* Edmond already owned companies in Brazil toy companies % in De Beers mining
in So *end* Africa joint business ventures with Robert Vesco and % of Club Mediterranean which
Edmond co-founded *end* Club Mediterranean was created out of the idea that others of the elite would
enjoy seaside playgrounds like those he and his mother cavorted at when he was a youngster *end* Edmond
went on to marry a chorus girl named Nadine Actually sources indicate that the Baron Edmond had
wanted to give the Bank of California to his only son *end* Bengie Benjam in de Rothschild as a
graduation present *end* But Bengie who was going to Pepperdine University was more interested in
partying *end* Bengie lived high on the hog at a fabulous California beach house while flunking school and
living wildly *end* Apparently his father decided his son wasn’t ready for a graduation present *end* In fact he
left Pepperdine Univ *end* after  years with  credits  short to graduate and went back home to
Chateau Pregny on the shore of Lake Geneva near Geneva *end* Switz *end* It wasn’t until  that Benjamin
stepped forward into the world of finance by launching his La Compagnie de Tresorerie-Benjamin de
Rothschild *end* The San Jose Mercury *end* Jan *end*   reported The longtime chief executive of the blue-
blood San Francisco bank invited Rothschild to invest *end* Banking regulators encouraged Rothschild to
take charge *end* Securities investigators ignored the frenzy of trading overseas and later the
documentation of insider trading *end* The bank’s directors fawned while the baron used it as a personal
plaything *end* This is not what made this country great." says Bill Miles a former BankCal vice
president *end* "This is greed all the way through." Edmond Rothschild only purchased a mInority of
BankCal’s shares but he was still able to totally control the company *end* He was also able to manipulate
its stock prices and carry out insider trading without the Securities and Exchange Commission
watching it *end* Edmond named two representatives to the board of directors *end* The first was George
Coulon Karlweis a patrician Swiss Banker who worked for Edmond *end* The other was George Shapiro *end* a New York lawyer who knew nothing about banking *end* Edmond has called George Shapiro his
"godfather and his "guardian angel." Then Edmond replaced De Bretteville as CEO with his man
Chauncey Schmidt *end* Edmond had agreed to leave DeBretteville in his position as a condition to
purchase BankCal shares but when he chose to renege on his agreement he did without compassion *end* Bank board meetings became a game of What does Edmond think?" Edmond on his part threw
parties that enamored him to San Francisco’s high society *end* Edmond carried out a series of actions
which dropped the value of BankCal’s stock drastically *end* Financial advisors and securities analysts
convinced small stockholders to sell their BankCAl stock which they then did for rock bottom prices
as little as  a share *end* Rothshild bought some at that price *end* Some of Rothschild’s secret proxies paid
slightly higher prices *end* Most of the stock went to anonymous investors trading through private banks
protected by secrecy laws *end* Nearly % of the bank’s stock was sold by misled shareholders and was
sold to secret European bank accounts *end* The Baron and his friends secretly began buying the Bank’s
stock after It had hit rock bottom prices *end* During  to  more than % of Bank of California’s
stock was sold in Europe *end* Such an abrupt shift in a stock’s trading pattern is supposed to set off
alarms with the Securities and Exchange Commission *end* Instead the Securities and Exchange
Commission turned a blind eye to all the insider trading *end* The European buyers bought their cheap
stock as secretly as possible *end* They did not openly shop through American brokerages *end* Instead they
bought small and therefore *end* unremarkable blocks of stock through dozens of private banks in
Switzerland the Netherlands *end* Germany *end* Luxembourg *end* The Baron told his friends that he would sell
BankCal while he publicly gave the appearance that the company was not for sale *end* For instance
publicly It was announced that David Rockefeller *end* as well as the elite’s front man for BCCI Ghaith
Pharaon had both taiked with Edmond Rothschild about the purchase of BankCal *end* According to what

the public was led to believe *end* Rothschild said he would not sell his shares in the bank *end* Jean Marc
Vemes a buddy of Edmond *end* bought  *end* shares through a defunct Asian mining company *end* He
was anonymous until Edmond Rothschild nominated him to the bank’s board of directors *end* After
gathering up shares at rock bottom prices Rothschild announced an official change of heart to sell the
bank at  a share *end* Rothschild then sold this supposedly American bank to the Japanese Mitsubishi
to be exact and made a killing" off of his manipulations and insider trading *end* In Mar *end*
Mitsubishi began secret negotiation to buy the bank which they codenamed Snoopy." Over the
years stockholders had watched various companies offer  a share  a share and other good
terms only to be rebuffed *end* When Rothschild finally sold for  a share to the Japanese it was clear
that his whole goal had been to cheat stockholders to Insure a big cash reward for himself *end* Richard
Freemon a large stockholder who had sold *end* sued Rothschild and the directors for cheating him on his
stock *end* The  million dollar lawsuit was settled out of court with all parties swearing not to disclose
how much Freemon got for having lost money due to Rothschild’s stock manipulations *end*
THE ROUND TABLE GROUP

David Smith who has written the following article on the Rothschilds for this newsletter asked me to
explain in this introduction about Rothschild and the Round Table Group *end* The men who formed
Milner’s Round table group from the various clues in their lives were by and large secret satanists *end* Rhodes and Stead created a secret society which had a circle of initiates." This circle included such
names as Albert Lord Grey Arthur Lord Balfour Sir Harry Johnston and Lord Rothschild *end* Milner
was on the executive committee of this secret group *end* Carroll Quigley dates the start of the group as
March i  *end* Apparently the Rothschilds helped finance this secret society *end* In - this secret
society in turn formed Round Table groups in British dependencies and the U.S *end* Eight of these round
table groups were still functioning into the s *end* Sir Abe Bailey supported the Round Table groups
quarterly magazine called The Round Table in  Sir Abe Bailey and the Astors financed the
creation of the Royal Institute of International Affairs which in turn created daughter organizations
such as the Council on Foreign Relations in the United States *end* The RIIA is also sometimes called
Chatham House *end* The first Round Table group of the Rhode-Milner group were sometimes called the
Cliveden Set because they often met at the Astor’s Cliveden Estate *end* Terence O’Brien’s biography
describes Milner’s relationship to the Rothschild’s as very close Lord Alfred Milner -
frequently visited the Rothschilds stayed overnight with various Rothschilds and even had some
sleepless nights with them *end* without explanation as to why *end* Milner also worked for Rothschild as a
director of Rio Tinto *end* Three Illuminati families stand out in the creation of the Round Table groups
which then became the RIIA and the CFR and related groups *end* These are the Rothschilds Astors and
Greys *end* The Bailey family also shows up an important generational satanic family *end* The RIIA and its
various branches such as the CFR are very powerful today *end* In my Be Wise As Serpents book readers
can find a chart showing the role the CFR plays in the Policy Process of the U.S *end*


THE ROTHSCHILDS--PART

BY DAVID SMITH

The Rothschild family reached a peak in Its power during the Age of Metternich - but as
the century waned so did Rothschild power *end* They still held a considerable amount of influence but
their veto power" was not as strong as It had been before the Revolutionary overthrow of
Metternich’s Europe *end* This lagging power was nothing that could not be reversed though and last half
of the  century was spent manufacturing another incredible climb upward *end* The new rise in power
came about during the reign of the "New Trinity" - Alphonse France Lionel England and Anselm
Vienna *end* The succeeding generations of these three family leaders were the catalysts of new family
order *end* An excellent example of Rothschild power in the late  century is the families dealings with
the Illuminati Habsburgs *end* In order to be courtworthy for the Habsburgs you had to have four ancestral
lines of nobility and you had to be baptized *end* Yet Emperor Francis Joseph gave the Rothschilds a
special act of grace" in  *end* From then on the House was allowed to be on close terms with the

Habsburgs *end* This was a considerable act *end* The European nobility are very serious about their
aristocratic rules *end* Francis Joseph was not very close to the House but his wife was a good friend of
the Rothschilds *end* Another great example of Rothschild influence is their direct Involvement on both
sides of the Austro-Prussian and Franco-Prussian Wars *end* Bismarck *end* dictator of Prussia was a sort of
son to fatheriess Amschel of Frankfort *end* After Amschel died Bismarck remained close to the
Rothschilds although he had occasional quibbles with the family *end* Bismarck’s banker Bleichroder
was a Rothschild agent and the richest man in Berlin *end* He was invaluable to Bismarck as the financier
of the dictator’s wars with Austria and France *end* In Austria the Hapsburgs were at least publicly
Implored by Alphonse and Anthony of Paris and Anselm of Vienna to avoid a war with the ambitious
Prussian dictator at all costs *end* Of all the international banking families the Rothschilds appeared to be
in favor of peace the most although this was probably a ruse *end* We want peace at any price" said
Anthony de Rothschild *end* "What do we care about Germany or Austria or Belgium *end* That sort of thing
is out of date." But the Austrians gave in to Bismarck’s provocations and embarked on a war with
Prussia in  the Rothschilds had all congregated in London for a family wedding the year before;
it is possible the wedding was used as an excuse to assemble the family together to discuss a plan of
action concerning the up-coming events  *end* Austria had been warned *end* In seven weeks the war was
over Bismarck had crushed the Austrians *end* The war had been financed by Rothschild agent
Bleichroder *end* Then Bismarck began to provoke France *end* Napoleon III was in the pocket of the head of
all the Rothschilds Alphonse de Rothschild of the Paris House *end* In fact the two even shared the same
mistress *end* Alphonse also had "access" to Bismarck *end* He was on both sides of the track so to speak *end* Then very possibly under Rothschild direction Bismarck began to try to put a German prince on the
Spanish throne *end* Napoleon III responded by telling Alphonse that France could not allow such a thing
and unless England intervened diplomatically he would have no choice but to go to war against
Prussia *end* The Emperor wished to use the Rothschild’s courier/agent system to reiay this message to
England *end* Baron Alphonse did so sending the message to Nathaniel de Rothschild at New Court who
relayed it to a close family Mend and former Prime Minister Gladstone England happened to be
without a Prime Minister at that time *end* Gladstone shedding *end* I believe a light on the family’s own
opinions answered the message with a refusal to intervene *end* The stage was set *end* Although Bismarck
withdrew his SpanIsh candidate the frictions between France and Prussia had become irreconcilable *end* Napoleon III declared war on Prussia in  *end* Explained one biographer "No one foresaw the fall of
France *end* Indeed crowned beads and statesmen alike believed that at long last Bismarck *end* had taken on
an impossible task." Despite everyone’s confidence in France Alphonse sent his family to England *end* He apparently knew better *end* Napoleon III suffered a terrible defeat *end* His empire came to an end *end* This
war was also financed by the Rothschild agent Bleichroder *end* Here comes the great puzzle concerning
the whole affair *end* Biographers using diaries and such seem to think the Rothschilds were very
distraught over Napoleon III’s loss *end* But It also appears they were behind the whole mess *end* Perhaps the
fear of the unpredictability of the new revolution caused this dismay *end* Perhaps It is just Rothschild
disinformation *end* Perhaps their pan was to keep connections on both sides of the conflict and ride out
the storm but they were upset because their philosophical loyalty was to France although I find this
hard to believe *end* The family had their hands in both sides of the conflict it even appears they
manufactured the conflict why the outcome might have upset them I have no idea *end* I personally
believe the House of Rothschild wanted to get rid of Napoleon Ill and his empire which is exactly
what happened the third republic was set up in France *end* After the war the French economy was
devastated *end* The Rothschild agent Junius Morgan was brought in to help restore the French financial
situation *end* He made a large profit *end* As you can see the Rothschild’s involvement in the Austro-Prussian
and Franco-Prussian Wars was significant even though they were crying peace *end*
FRENCH HOUSE LATE TH AND EARLY TH CENTURY

Alphonse of the "New Trinity" was the  bead of the House of Rothschild *end* He was an aristocratic
man and friend of many prominent leaders of his day *end* He was also an adulterer his most notable
affair being with the Comtesse de Castiglione *end* He and his wife were called "the most lavish
entertainers of their day." The sophisticated Alphonse was even friends with Belgium’s King Leopold
and England’s Prince of Whales *end* He also improved upon his Inherited network of Rothschild agents
an underground system that would continue to grow well after his death *end* He was one of best Informed

men of his day *end* His older sister Charlotte married Nathaniel of the English House *end* His brother
Gustave also had an affair with the Comtesse de Castiglione *end* His youngest brother Edmond # was a
genius and a main figure in the creation of a Jewish homeland in Israel *end* He helped divide the world’s

Saint-Victor that the young Rothschild who died the other day really died of the excitement of
gamblIng on the Stock Exchange *end* Imagine it; a Rothschild dead of a paroxysm over money.’

Salomon they would have been even more enthralled *end* Three years earlier Salomon had ‘dropped
dead’ *end* He had been placed in a comn and according to Jewish custom carried into every room in the
house *end* One of the pall bearers had stumbled the coffin had crashed Into a door and -Salomon had
woken up *end* Not for another three years was he well and truly buried." This story could lead to all sorts
of speculation *end* De Rothschild Freres the French House bank was very powerful *end* It got its hands Into

Investments with people who might strike a painful blow to his riches *end* "Natty was brusque and
humorless and dld not suffer fools gladly." Nor could he allow his money Into the hands of a fool
caution was a necessary device as far as he was concerned *end* According to the writer Frank Harris the
Lord Rothschild told him I go to the bank New Court every morning and when I say ‘no’ I return
home at night without a worry *end* But when I say ‘yes’ Its like putting your finger Into a machine - the
whirring wheels may drag your whole body in after the finger." New Court was very powerful at this
time for example It controlled the Ruby Mines in Burma and the banks operations covered most of
South America *end* Brazil was the Rothschild’s "preserve" in South America as Argentina was the

ran for a second term and appointed a new vice-president Theodore Roosevelt a lock stock and
barrel Illuminatus *end* Less than a year later he was assassinated *end* When "Teddy" became president the

of  *end* The whole Incident helped the elite push for a central bank *end* One man who knew of the plot
was historian Frederick Lewis Allen who wrote in LIFE magazine ...certain chroniclers have
arrived at the ingenious conclusion that the Morgan interests took advantage of the unsettled
conditions during the autumn of  to precipitate the Panic guiding It shrewdly as it progressed so
that it would kill off rival banks and consolidate the pre-eminence of the banks within the Morgan

orbit." The Panic of  made people want a powerful central bank that could "protect" the common

Rothschild connections to the first worid war are an excellent example of controlled conflict *end* On the
Allied side the British and French Houses financially supported their countries battles *end* Some
Rothschilds were even soldiers although they didn’t see much action *end* J.P *end* Morgan Bank was a big
financial help to the Allied cause *end* It was the Allies "purchasing agent" until the U.S *end* entered the war *end* It also created a syndicate that financed modernization" in China to help defend that country against
the Japanese threat *end* The elite wanted America in the war *end* Historian Charles Tansill noted .. *end* the
large banking Interests were deeply interested in the World War because of wide opportunities for
large profits *end* On August   even before the actual clash of arms the French firm of Rothschild
Freres cabled to Morgan and Company in New York suggesting the floatation of a loan of
 a substantial part of which was to be left in the United States to pay for French
purchases of American goods.’ The Lusitania was a ploy *end* It was packed with some Morgan owned
ammunition had been given over to England as a member of the navy and despite the warnings of
the Germans was sent Into a naval war zone specifically to be a target - the catalyst for America’s
entrance to the war *end* A knowledgeable American State Department failed to warn the US *end* citizens
aboard the ship of the voyages definite danger *end* Churchill ordered the Lusitanina’s naval escort to
return to port and the fated ship was left unprotected to be sunk *end* Rothschild agent Colonel House
probably knew of this plot records point to a discussion of it between him and Sir Edward Grey of
England *end* Historian Colin Simpson called the sinking of the Lusitania the "foulest act of willful
murder ever committed on the seas.’ On the Axis side the Rothschild network was also funneling
money *end* Another family allied to the Rothschilds was the Warburgs *end* Max Warburg brother of Kuhn-
Loeb’s Paul Warburg *end* ran a family financial powerhouse in Frankfort Germany one of the reasons

Kuhn-Loeb Colonel House Thomas Lamont of Morgans and Allen Dulles of Kuhn-Loeb *end* The
harsh terms of the Treaty of Versailles totally set the stage for World War II *end* Said one delegate ‘This
is no peace; this is only a truce for twenty years." Sure enough in  the second World War
started *end* Another product of the Versailles meetIngs was the elite’s Charter for the League of Nations -
the Illuminati’s first attempt at creating a global institution *end* The League of Nations failed *end* This called
for the need to create a think tank/special Interest organization that could promote the new world
order *end* Thus the creation of the Foreign Relations Institutions - the CFR *end* RIIA etc *end* This will be

WORLD WAR II

The second World War was also controlled by Illuminati and Rothschild interests *end* The Great
Depression did not only occure in America *end* It also swept Europe *end* The economic depression in
Europe coupled with an extremely harsh Versailles Treaty helped fan the flames of the nationalistic
fires that swept Germany *end*
Hitier was a member of the most powerful occultic secret society in Germany *end* He penetrated the inner
circle of this society where Satanism was practiced *end* Hitler was dedicated to Satan’s Empire - an evil
puppet *end* He was brought into this evil group by Dietrich Eckart who is supposed to have said on his
deathbed "Follow Hitler *end* He will dance but It is I who have called the tune *end* I have initiated him into
the ‘Secret Doctrine’; opened his centers in vision and given him the means to communicate with the
Powers *end* Do not mourn for me I shall have influenced history more than any German.’ In the last
article we discussed the possibility of Hitler having been of Rothschild descendance *end* Consider this -
he probably had satanic bloodline he had the backing of a powerful satanic society he had sold his

soul to Satan and he had the financial backing of the Illuminati *end* is it any wonder that he rose from
obscurity poverty and Imprisonment to become one of the most powerful men to ever live *end* I believe
that It is even safe to specuiate that Hitler was totally controlled by a demonic spirits; that he simply
gave himself over to Satan’s control *end* An ex-member of the Satanic Hierarchy of the Illuminati
expressed a belief to me that there have been certain evil men through-out history that have totally

given themselves over to possession by Satan *end* That these men Hitler Ghengis Khan for example
have been anti-christ types simply human containers for the residence of a very powerful demonic
spirit or even Satan himself *end* The ex-illuminati member believed that when Satan no longer had need
for the body of his anti-christ he would discard It with death and find another willing soul to sacrifice
his bodily control to the devil *end* These evil figures would not be ‘The" Anti-Christ explained the
informant but would have allowed themselves to taken over by "the spirit" of the Anti-Christ *end* This is
just a theory but I believe it has certain merit *end* If it is true it paints an interesting picture of Hitler and
the ruling class that created him *end* Hitler’s main source of economic power was from the I.G *end* Farben
chemical cartel and I.G *end* Farben in turn was controlled by the Illuminati *end* The I.G *end* Farben cartel was
created by loans from Wall Street in what has been called the Dawes plan *end* Carroll QuIgley calls the
Dawes Plan "largely a J.P *end* Morgan production." The J.P *end* Morgan Group set up the loan to I.G *end* Farben which created Hitler *end* Without the capital supplied by Wall Street there would have been no
I.G *end* Farben in the first place and almost certainly no Adolf Hitler and Worid War II." Henry Ford
merged his German assets with I.G *end* Farben in  *end* The cartel created the lethal Zyklon B gas that
was used to exterminate the Jews *end* It was also involved in the torture experimentations that led to
mind control methods such as Monarch Programming *end* Do you see what happened *end* A Rothschild

disadvantage if they were to embark on a second world war *end* The nation had a fuel shortage but the
Illuminati fixed this problem *end* The Germans were able to fight WWII through the use of synthetic
fuels that were created by the hydrogenation process turning coal into gasoline *end* This process was
discovered by I.G *end* Farben *end* Hydrogenation technology would not have been fully developed by
WWII but I.G *end* Farben made a deal with Rockefeller’s Standard Oil who was able to complete the
research facilitating the war *end* Interestingly I.G *end* Farben plants were not targeted by the bombing raids
on Germany *end* By the end of the war the refineries had experienced only % damage *end* William Dodd
American ambassador to Germany before WWII wrote President Roosevelt "At the present moment
more than a hundred American corporations have subsidiaries here or cooperative understandings *end* The DuPonts have their allies in Germany that are aiding in the armament business *end* Their chief ally

take nothing earnings out except in goods *end* ‘Even our airplanes people have secret arrangements
with Krupps *end* ‘General Motors Company which was controlled by the J.P *end* Morgan Group and Ford
do enormous business here through their subsidiaries and take no profits out." Germany needed the

holding company in the United States called American I.G *end* Farben *end* Paul Warburg his brother Max
head of Germanies secret police during WWI and Warburg agent Herman Metz were some of the
members of the board of directors of the American I.G *end* Farben *end* Other directors included

Germans on the Board of Governors were convicted as war criminals after the war but the elite
Americans fore-mentioned were not even though they participated in the same criminal decisions as
those who were punished *end* According to author Eustice Mullins Hitier met with Allen and John
Foster Dulles in  *end* The Dulles brothers were acting as legal representatives of Schiff and
Warburg’s Kuhn Loeb & Co which was an Integral part of the Rothschild network *end* Mullins claims
Kuhn & Loeb had extended large short-term credits to Germany and needed to ensure the repayment
of these loans *end* The Dulles supposedly assured Hitler he would receive the funds necessary to be
installed as Chancellor of Germany if he promised to repay the debts *end* One of the largest tank
manufacturers for Germany was Opel which was controlled by the J.p *end* Morgan Group *end* Another
company connected to the J.p *end* Morgan Group was Bendix Aviation ‘which supplied data to

Germany on automatic pilots aircraft Instruments and aircraft and diesel engine starters.’ The
examples go on and on *end* There is much more that could be written on this subject *end* The manufactured
Pearl Harbor attack allowed Roosevelt to enter America into the war *end* A second worid war had been
created by the Illuminati with the help of the Rothschild/Morgan/Warburg/Schiff syndicate *end* After the
end of the war the Tribunals that investigated Nazi war criminals censored "any materials recording
Western assistance to Hitler" said historian Antony C *end* Sutton *end*
GLOBALISM

World War II facilitated the American acceptance of a giobal ‘peacekeeping" institution - the United
Nations *end* After the U.S *end* had rejected the first attempt to create such an institution in the League of
Nations the illuminatI decided to create an arm of the Rothschild funded Round Table groups which
could help influence western society towards the embracement of globalism *end* The original idea was to
create an international special interest group of advisors that would promote a New World Order
called the Institute of on International Affairs *end* The plan eventually changed the Institute was split up
so that separate groups could influence separate governments without having the appearance of a
conspiracy *end* These groups were formed at what are called the Hotel Majestic meetings *end* Baron #
Edmond de Rothschild of France was the main force behind these meetings and all the founders of
these groups were men who had met with his approval *end* Chief of these was Rothschild agent Colonel
Edward Mandell House *end* One of these groups was the CFR. *end* The CFR Handbook of  explains
how It was established *end* ‘On May   several leading members of the delegations to the Paris
Peace Conference met at the Hotel Majestic in Paris to discuss setting up an international group
which would advise their respective governments on international affairs... *end* It was decided at this
meeting to call the proposed organization the Institute of International Affairs *end* At a meeting on June
  the planners decided it would be best to have separate organizations cooperating with each
other *end* Consequentiy they organized the Council on Foreign Relations with headquarters in New
York *end* and a sister organization the Royal Institute of International Affairs RIIA in London also
known as the Chatham House Study Group to advise the British Government *end* A subsidiary
organization the Institute of Pacific Relations was set up to deal exclusively with Far Eastern Affairs
and facilitated the Pearl Harbor attack  *end* Other organizations were set up in Paris and Hamburg the
Hamburg branch being called the Institut fur Auswartige Politik *end* and the Paris branch being known as
Centre d’Etudes de Politicque Etrangere..." I have never seen any research on the Institut fur
Auswartige Politik in Germany *end* It wouid be interesting to see how this group was Involved with the
elite and the creation of WWII *end*
A group of Illuminati wise men took the plans laid out at the Hotel Majestic meetings and formed the
CFR *end* The founders included; Colonel Edward Mandell

A NOTE ABOUT THE KRUPPS OF GERMANY

It has been said by an Illuminati informant that the Krupp ramily is part of the Illuminati *end* It is clear
that that the Krupp family must be at least in agreement to the plans of the Illuminati *end* This can be said
because of the extensive power of the Krupps *end* The Krupps were the primary producers of the big
guns for the German army in W.W.I *end* Lenin wanted the Krupps to help him make the Russian steppes
productive *end* The Krupps have produced agricultural equippment and train locomotives as well as
tanks *end* After W.W *end* I had ended the head of the Krupp family Gustav Krupp von Bohlen und
Halbach began secretly planning to rebuild Germany’s military might *end* Gustav Krupp bought coal
mines after W.W *end* I with an eye on using them for future weapons production *end* After the Allied
Control Commission departed Germany in  Krupp factories began secretly turning out a few
tanks particularly at Krupp’s Garusonwerk Factory *end* The Christian Science Monitor which ties in with
the occult system sent reporters to Krupps factories during the s to report on how well the
Germans were complying with the Versailles Treaty limitations *end* The reporters gave a clean bill of
health to the Krupp factories even though the reporters should have questioned why all their film was
destroyed during factory tours infared rays were beamed Into their film while they toured Krupps
factories *end* Prussian-trained Gustav Krupp had married the daughter of Friedrich Krupp whose name
was Bertha *end* Bertha was a powerful woman and sole owner in  of one of Germany’s largest steel
firms *end* The Krupps have lived above Essen German in a hugh palace called Villa Huegel whose
small wing has  rooms *end* They also have other castles and villas *end* At one time they owned as far as I
know they still do a castle in the Austrian Alps named Bluehnbach *end* Gustav Krupp hosted and was
one of the leaders of a secret group of  powerful German industrialists called the Ruhrlade which
secretly made Germany’s industrial decisions during the Weimar Republic *end* This group also made
political decisions *end* In  Krupp began to help HItler *end* The secret governing body of the Ruhrlade
covered their meetings behind the cover of having lavish hunting parties *end* The Illuminati kept close
tabs and gave secret support to Hitler on his rise to power *end* Illuminatus William Randolph Hearst had

PART  *end* THE ROTHSCHILDS TODAY

by Fritz Springmeier

Introduction to Part  *end* The Rothschilds are one of the most prominent of the top thirteen Illuminati
families *end* This newsletter has been singling out each of the top thirteen Illuminati families for a feature
article *end* Articles in this newsletter have already been done on the Astor Buady Collins DuPont
Freeman U Kennedy Onassis and Van Duyn families *end* The Rockefellers were featured in a
December  article just prior to this series *end* Because there is more Information out about the

Rothschilds than some of the other families I decided to write more than just one feature article about
them *end*
Reviewing the recent newsletter articles *end*
The first set of my recent Rothschild articles consisted of my Introduction and then main article *end* The
Introduction covered the hidden lineages of the Springs the Payseurs the Beatty family and Abraham
Lincoln *end* The main article by David Smith covered the  and  centuries of Rothschild power *end* The second set of articles again consisted of my introduction along with a main article *end* In my
Introduction I covered some about their secret power their power in Latin America and their secret
power to manipulate financial things without playing the same rules as others play *end* David Smith’s
main article covered the Rothschild’s influence in history in the late  century and during the
century *end*
The Rothschilds a daily threat

My desire was to have an article about what the Rothschild’s are doing today *end* One of my most
dangerous opponents in this area to the work I’m doing against the Monarch program is a secret
Rothschild descendent *end* I know Monarch slaves who were created to serve the Rockefeller family the
Russell family the  Holy Blood Family the Li family and the CollIns family *end* I also know
Monarch slaves who were created to serve the Rothschilds *end* From what I have been told and also from
just personal observation all of the top  IllumInati families are involved in the creation of Monarch
slaves *end* It goes without saying that It is Impossible to be a high level Satanist and not have MPD *end* Any
person without MPD would go insane after participating in high level Illuminati rituals *end* It can’t be
stated with certainty that all Illuminati members by Illuminati I mean members of the first pyramidal
structure diagrammed in the Jan *end*  ' newsletter and in the Feb *end* I Issue have been through Monarch
programming today but it can be stated with certainty that they all suffer from multiple personality
disorder *end* This means that the Rothschilds in this country and in Canada and the U.K. *end* have closely
collaborated with the highest levels of the intelligence community and the military *end* Who initiated my
phone being tapped *end* At any rate the Rothschilds and their satanic power is here in America and
people need to understand that *end*


The first great temple *end*
The Illuminati are building their temples secretly throughout the United States *end* The last issue of this
newsletter described the massive pyramid that has been built at Los Vegas *end* Pyramids have also been
built at San Francisco the Trans-America building and in Chicago and in other eastern places *end* The
San Francisco building was built by people with ties to the Rockefellers *end* Just north of San Francisco
and east of the Bohemian Grove is the Napa Valley of California *end* Anton LaVey moved to Napa
Valley after his split with Aquino *end* LaVey ran a construction company during the  *end* out of Napa
CA *end* As an aside Anton LaVey’s chief representative in our Portland area is Rex Diablos" Church
who grew up as Rex Nance in Seaside High School on the Oregon coast *end* Rex worked at the drug
store at Broadway and Holiday at Seaside during high school *end* Two years after high school he returned
to his hometown with his head shaved and wearing black in LaVey fashion *end* He had a stripper who
dressed in black who was a Satanist as his girl friend for a while in the Portland area *end* According to
Rex’s own words he grew up in a secret Satanic family and was baptized to Satan as a child *end* Rex and
his Satanic friends have schemed how to hurt the Christians *end* How many of their devious plans have
succeeded I do not know *end* Also of Interest is that Rex lived a good deal with his what has been
reported as Jehovah’s Witness grandparents *end* With the Church of Satan feeling comfortable in Napa
it is not surprising that tbe Baron and Baroness Phillipi de Rothschild picked the area to build a secret
temple to Satan *end*
Also as readers of this newsletter know these people have been constructing castles and other large
buildings on spiritual ley lines for centuries so it goes without saying that when this secret temple
was built in Napa that the Icy lines were at least considered in choosing a site *end* The Baron Rothschild

began the construction of a pyramid in Napa Valley which his wife completed after he died *end* The
pyramid is called Opus  *end* According to one of the contractors who participated in building the

pyramid the project cost  million *end* The various construction cost reports given the public have
been much less than what this contractor has said was the real cost of the building *end* The theme of the
numbers  and  runs throughout the large Opus i pyramid building *end* as well as the number  *end* Also
little circles frequently appear *end*
The name of the building is Opus  which means the First Work *end* It’s cover or front for the temple is
that It is a winery *end* The winery operates very strangely to a legitimate winery *end* The entire project of
buying the land building Opus  and operating it has been shrouded in secrecy *end* The wineries in
California when they open traditionally and normally are open to the public *end* The opening ceremonies
of Opus  were shrouded in secrecy *end* The opening announcement was low key and only select people
and select International media types were Invited *end* This opening is extremely unusual for a winery in
the Napa Valley area *end* Private guided tours are very hard to obtain of Opus  in contrast to the other
wineries in Napa Valley *end* Further the estate that the winery temple sits on is very protected and
secluded *end* The wrought iron gates are always closed *end* However I was able to get a first hand report
from a group of three that managed to view Opus  *end* During the tour this group saw many occult and
satanic items and yet large areas of the winery temple were closed off to even this private tour
group *end* The winery is not constructed even remotely similar to any winery in the Us *end* The project
began as a joint venture between Robert Mondavi and Baron Rothschild in  *end* The land was
secretly purchased and in the late s construction quietly began using contractors from far away *end* Strangely the Napa Valley Register which reports on all building activity remained extremely quiet
about what was being built *end* From the air the construction forms a masonic square and compass *end* On
the Inside hidden stairwells and other hidden features have been built in *end* The capstone of the pyramid
has a rotunda where skylight penetrates the capstone and where viewers can get a view of the entire
Napa Valley *end* There have numerous Rothschilds who have entered Into the various Masonic rites *end* For
Instance Louis Rothschild was a ° Scottish Rite Mason in Chicago during the ’s *end* The reason
for this is that Freemasonry is used as type of early class for those who are in the Illuminati to get
them familiar with the symbols of the Mystery religions and give them more practice with hand
signals rituals and secrecy *end* Orchids which are used by the Mothers of Darkness are grown all over
the area *end* Orchids are the only type of flower grown on the site and they are cared for by apparently
Mothers of Darkness who are dressed in all black which is the standard color of garb of the Mothers
of Darkness *end* The pyramid was built with limestone from Texas *end* No doubt there is some occult
significance to the site that the limestone came from *end* The limestone itself has fossils which have
been hidden from easy view for some reason *end* Remember the ancient Egyptian pymmids used
limestone *end* Originally Opus I was scheduled to open around the Summer Solstice but the date was
shifted to Weds *end* Oct *end*   which is the day before Halloween *end* Since the opening day the
Rothschilds have had events scheduled around Satanic high days *end* Those who are familiar with the
occult know that these events are covers for Satanic rituals which are held secretly *end* The land has
wrought iron gates which are locked at all times *end* Some of the occult Items which private visitors saw
within the pyramid were a book on wine depicting orgies by Salvadore Dailey who is a Satanist a
blue-black picture with naked ritual dancers and other strange occultic pieces of art such as an oil
painting of what looked like Satan *end* Massive draconian oak doors are built facing the hail that leads to
the room where wine is tasted *end* Mirrors abound in the place *end* The guilded art work on the mirrors is
often Rococo *end* The Baroness personally designed and furnished the Interior *end* The upside down peace
sign is found designed in some of the furniture as barren trees *end* Two trees of life from Peru are by the
fireplace *end* The tree of life is by the way very Important to this level of the Illuminati *end* The visitors also
saw  Mouton ceremonial drinking cups with rams and chairs which had the carvings on the front
arms/legs of fully formed demons were found in one of the rooms *end* The foyer looks like the Inside of a
snail or corkscrewy." Much of the furnishings were purchased by the Baroness Rothschild from the
De Medicis *end* It has various marble floors and tables set with orchids *end* The stainless steel and the floors
in the winery are immaculate *end* The workers who work there were scrutinized closely before being
hIred *end* Originally the wine workers were required to were black pants and white shirts but the
workers who had to stomp the grapes were unhappy about the uniform requirements *end* I have been

trying to follow the Rothschild family with Its many branches *end* Although the Rothschilds are seen as
great internationalists don’t be surprised If some of the people of the Rothschilds seem somewhat
middleclass For instance in the Millington MI NE of Flint MI one family dominates the tows *end* This
family is the Bauer family *end* Stan Bauer was a man who mysteriously simply attracted material
possessions to himself without any visible source of money *end* His son Harold Bauer a ° Mason who
sat on the Houghton Lake city council *end* His next son Terry Bauer was also a Mason also had a
position in local government and was on the school beard *end* His daughter Barbers Bauer married Jim
Hagger who was also a Mason who lived in Grand Blanc south of Flint *end* There is certainly more that
could be said about the satanic Rothschild bloodline but this is where I will bring this article to a
close with the statement that Lord Welling I will write more about them later *end*
Bloodlines of Illuminati

By

Fritz Springmeier

The Russell Bloodline



THE WATCHTOWER & THE ILLUMINATI

Last year in the Jan *end* ’ newsletter I wrote an artide about the Illuminati and the Watchtower Society *end* Recently on Dec *end*  ’ Texe Marrs interviewed me over international short wave radio about the
 book "The Watchtower and the Masons." Having got a good response from the short wave radio
interview it is only appropriate that this newsletter starts off the new year with another article on the
Watchtower Society and the Illuminati *end* Because of numerous problems within the congregations of
Jehovah’s Witnesses with Satanic Ritual Abuse the Watchtower Society put out an article in the Oct *end*   issue of the magazine *end* Lee Waters of Bethel Headquarters kept a file on his computer of
Jehovah’s Witnesses who were reported to be victims of SKA *end* It is possible headquarters has told him
to delete the file *end* Another man who was at headquarters who is now believed out of the Society was
also well informed of SRA among the congregations of Jehovah’s Witnesses *end* In fact two J.W.s who
had actually been in the Illuminati while J.W.s but had broken free confronted the Governing Body
and headquarters with their evidence of the Illuminati operating within the membership of the
Jehovah’s Witnesses *end*
What was the response of the WF leaders *end* To simply ignore and coverup the evidence *end* The actions of
the Governing Body in squelching any serious action against the high level Satanism secretly
operating within the Jehovah’s Witnesses shows what my Be Wise A Serpents book revealed which
is that very secret high level Satanism has long been controlling the Watchtower Society *end* One of
these  eyewitnesses to Illuminati activities within the higher levels of the Watchtower Society
realized that something is seriously wrong at the top when the WF leaders do not really care for those
people in the congregations who are becoming the victims of SRA *end* One elder in good standing lost
his position because be warned the WT Society of satanic infiltration *end* It is obvious that the
Watchtower organization is more interested in public relations than it is in having a clean
organization *end* In examining the families that are involved with the Illuminati who use the Watchtower
Society as a cover we find a continuation of the same pattern as I noticed before there is a large
contingent of Scottish and a large Jewish bloodlines *end* For instance one J.W *end* Illuminati family was the
Udell family Scottish name who married Picketson Milliken English maiden name with Jewish
first husband *end*
This type of combination typifies so many of the elite who I have researched *end* In the Be Wise As
Serpents book chapter  *end* discusses how the Satanism within the Illuminati and the Watchtower
Society could be tracked by an understanding of Enochian magic *end* Readers may want to refer back to
that chapter after reading this paragraph *end* The Illuminati operating within the Watchtower Society use
the Enochian Language which has its own language and its own Enochian alphabet letters in boxes *end* According to eyewitnesses who have left the J.W *end* part of the Illuminati the Enochian alphabet is
known and used as the cult language by those Illuminati operating in the high levels of the
Watchtower Society *end* In other words their ceremonies are done in this ritual Enochian language *end* Sir
William Sinclair in the  century was one of those who introduced Enochian Magic to Scotland *end* The Scottish connection in the Watchtower Society is overpowering *end* Both the Russell and the



Rutherford families came from Scotland as well as MacMillan and many other key eariy Watchtower
leaders *end* From this it appears that the Scottish type of Illuminatism that created the early Watchtower
Society has always practiced Enochian magic *end* Remember from the Be Wise As Serpents book that
knowing the Watchtowers is the key to Enochian magic *end* The same type of winged-sun-disk that C.T *end* Russell used was also used on the ........ *end* Magic *end* Two phrases that were popular among satanists who
practiced Enochian Magic in Rumli's day were ‘Millennial Dawn and ‘Golden Age.’ The following
are some of the Illuminati operating within the Watchtower Society today names may be spelled
incorrectly in some cases

Chris family - Domelie family-Irish bloodline

Karrls - JW Overseer in Miami FL Prince George McKee-Monroeville AL Melers or Myer-Jewish
Satanic bloodline *end*
Sharon Russell - left the Illuminati still a JW worked with police showing ritual sites *end*
Princess Proud Swift - lived in Delaware with the travel industry Jim Tifton-important WT official
and elder in So *end* Calif *end* A secret Satanic serial murderer *end*
Walt family - Woomer family- The areas which have been identified as strong Satanic stronghold
within the Watchtower religious empire are

Southern California cap *end* San Bernadino Valley Florida the Carribean Scotland Bethel
Headquarters in Brooklyn and various places in New York *end* I expect that this list of strongholds is
very incomplete *end* According to an eye witness of the Illuminati within the Watchtower Society the
following items can be ascertained

· Some type of trauma based mind control is being used to create MPD and control children born into
the Illuminati within the WF Society *end*
· The rank and file JWs have no awareness that the WT Society has a secret upper level of
involvement *end* Note I identified this upper level in my chart explaining how religions are controlled
by Satanism *end*
· The Illuminati within the Jehovah’s Witnesses have a hidden agenda that is separate from the
published goals of the WT Society although they also support many of the goals of the Society *end*
RITUAL SITES *end*
Beside rituals taking place in the above mentioned stronghold areas it is of value to point out that one
of the rituals that I have found out about took place when a boat load of generational satanic JWs
went to the Bahamas believed to be Andros Is *end* and had a ritual at a high place *end* This was in  *end*
Related items *end*
There are three items which relate to what has been described above *end*
· There is a particular man who is well informed about the WT Society who is able to explain bow the
WE Society is interlocked with a lot of major corporations *end*
· As a consequence of how connected the WT Society is with politics big business etc *end* the WE
Society has been closely watched by the FBI which has over  pages in its files on the WT
Society alone *end* This figure does not include its extensive files on individuals of which everyone of the
WE Society Presidents has had a file *end*
· The WT Society performs a secret ritual every year which is their primary ritual *end* This ritual is
actually the ancient gnostic satanic ritual of saying no to the body of Christ *end* This ancient satanic
ritual is now secretly practiced under the disguise of the Memorial Supper - where the elements of



communion are passed and no one partakes of the elements *end* When I say ‘no one’ I mean that in a
qualified sense-only a small group are allowed to partake *end* The actual figures of how many partake of
the elements is a totally fictitious figure according to my sources which is created at Bethel
headquarters in Brooklyn *end*
· Canadian citizens who have tried to find out why the Watchtower Society in Canada is allowed to
evade taxes have been stonewalled by government officials *end* MacGregor Ministries newsletter News
& Views Oct *end*  p *end*  discusses how various people have tried to expose the Watchtower’s
avoidance of the GST and how the Minister of Finance the Minister of National Revenue and many
other government groups have simply stonewalled people *end* The fax no *end* of one of the most powerful
committees of the Watchtower Society is the WT Service Dept *end* whose fax no *end* is - *end* This
newsletter will continue to bring articles on the various branches of Satan’s One World Religion
which includes the Mormon authority structure the Catholic authority structure the Pentecostal and
the Jehovah’s Witnesses authority structures just to name a few *end*
One of the strangest things for this Author was to continue running into evidence that seems to
indicate Charles Taze Russell the man who started the Jehovah’s Witnesses’ Watchtower Society
was secretly an important Satanist *end* Lest the reader devalue the evidence permit this author to state
that the evidence came in first before I came up with my theory that Russell was an important
Satanist and not vice-versa *end* Some of the outstanding clues are

a *end* C.T *end* Russell was definitely a Mason yet he puts up some great smokescreens in his writing
concerning his membership *end*
b *end* C.T *end* Russell’s Bethel staff became concerned about his occultic activities and required him to take
an oath forswearing any further occultic activities *end*
c *end* In my previous book The Watchtower and the Masons I study  parallel beliefs that Russell had
with Masonry *end* I spent a page per parallel *end* These  are not in any way inclusive Russell had many
other identical ideas to what the Masonic lodges propogate *end*
d *end* Various items from magic were part of Russell’s religious beliefs including healing handkerchiefs
phrenology the Winged-Sun-Disk Enochian Magical planes etc *end*
e *end* Russell’s family’s possible Illuminati links and his wife’s possible connections with a family line
of Satanists *end*
f *end* Russell’s apparent secret Rosicrucian membership with the Quakertown PA group of
Rosicrucians as revealed by the pyramid he ordered erected his use of the Winged-Sun-Disk *end* and his
cremation three days after his death *end*
g *end* Russell owned a cemetary in Pittsburgh *end* Leading Satanists try to own cemetaries for several
reasons *end* First it facilitates the disposal of human sacrifices which are buried in pieces below the fresh
holes dug for someone else’s burial *end* When the casket is placed in the hole it would be rare for anyone
to dig below the casket level ever again *end* Second magic power is associated with cemetaries *end* The
spiritual power of the dead is pulled up by making a circle of light over them then within the circle a
naked Satanist lays *end* Third specific bones are sought such as the skulls and left hands *end* Left hands are
preserved in order to hold candles for certain ceremonies *end*
h *end* Contacts from various places today indicate that the modern Watchtower Society is working with
the New World Order *end* This implies that at some point the Society began cooperating with the New
World Order *end* Russell seems to be the likeliest starting point *end*
UNDERSTANDING CHARLES T *end* RUSSELL

As with all occult organizations a veil of secrecy is maintained by requiring initiates to take secrecy
oaths on penalty of death *end* As in Witchcraft Masonry repeatedly demands secrecy oaths at every new



level *end* Charles T *end* Russell began participating in this secrecy when he took the Entered Apprentice
first Masonic degree oath on penalty of mayhem and violent death "I .. *end* do hereby and hereon most
solemnly and sincerely promise and swear that I will always hail ever conceal and never reveal any
of the arts parts or points of the secret arts and mysteries of ancient Freemasonry which I received
am about to receive or may hereafter be instructed in ..."



NOTES

 *end* Confidential interviews with ex-Satanists *end*
 *end* Interview by Dr *end* Al Carlisle with a Black Prince recorded in Stratford L *end* Satan’s Underground *end* p *end*  *end*
Should the reader allow I will quote from the Power’s own statements plus other proof to show that
this god the god of the world is Lucifer aka Satan Sanat Venus etc *end* For thousands of years The
Plan for world domination has been passed down from occult generation to occult generation *end* Spaced
every  is a Feast of the Beast a year-long holiday during which Satanists receive new instructions
from Satan on how to carry out The Plan.’ We read of the great holiday and its Great Councils in
Externalization of the Hierarchy when Satan’s instrument Alice Bailey writes "The past year.. *end* has
however been the year in which the greatest spiritual Approach of all time has shown itself to be
possible - an Approach for which the initiates and Masters have for centuries been preparing and for
which all the Wesak Festivals since the meeting of the Great Council in  have been preparatory *end* I
have in past instructions referred to the great meetings held at intervals by Those to Whom is
entrusted the spiritual guidance of the planet and particularly of man." Externalisation of the
Hierarchy p *end*  *end*
ONE SAMPLE OF THEIR PLANS

As example of how ingenius these plans are to create a One-World-Government consider the
following part of it *end* The Drug War is not what it seems *end* It is a very ingenious scheme to enslave the
American people and destroy all their civil rights *end* The first rumblings of the Drug War part of The
Plan seem to stir from the occult so it is highly possible the Drug War originally was first developed
by Satanists perhaps even given during one of the Feasts of the Beast *end* The Drug War seems like the
perfect plan with no way for the Power to lose *end* First the Power creates a drug culture in America *end* The Drug Culture would and did give many their first step into the Aquarian New Age conspiracy *end* The Power would make billions of dollars by running drugs to further finance other nefarious
schemes and could use their world-wide power to crush all their competitors *end* When the Power
crushed and arrested their competitors in drug running they would be hailed as heros by the majority
of people *end* And they have *end* The introduction of drugs into society does several things *end* It taxes the
Christian church’s ability to oppose immorality *end* It gets the public indignent about drugs and the
public’s moral outcry allows the Power to pass "drug" laws that remove the last vestiges of legal civil
rights *end* In fact the beguiled public demands the laws which abolish their rights and applauds these
laws in ignorance unknowing what the laws actually say and mean *end* If the public somehow gets a
complete picture that their government has been smuggling drugs to create a drug war in spite of the
controlled media or perhaps through the media at the right time then they can create a scandal
involving several U *end* S *end* Presidents to eliminate the U  *end* S *end* government and switch the public’s
alligience to a world government *end* See chapter  *end* for more details and a chronology of the secretly
planned escalation of today’s designed Drug War *end* As an ex-Mason who is very aware of their plans
said to this author "These people are in it for the long-term."

THE BLOODLINE OF THE RUSSELLS

The purpose of this next subsection may be misunderstood unless I make myself clear at this point *end* This author has not established any link between the various famous Russells *end* Although I have been
doing genealogy work I have not had the chance to do the long term geneology work required to
clarify the issue if the reader is dissatisfied with the extent of this information he is encouraged that



rather than criticize to research it himself *end* The reader will observe by the time he finishes this book
that this author has done extensive research into many groups *end* One item that has popped up
consistently is that people with the surname Russell repeatedly appear as important figures in the
various elements of the World Order as it has developed *end* Before becoming aware of the One World
Order this Author had no inkling how important blood lines have been for the elite that controls the
world *end* Friendships have also played a role for instance Eleanor Roosevelt who was involved in
numerous communist organizations’ and was an actual card carrying member of the American
communist party was a close friend and confidant to Ronald Reagon’s mother *end* This seems trivial but
the reoccurance of blood lines and the reoccurant discovery of connections of friendships between
what have been thought of as unrelated personages compels one to believe the elite is more compact
than appears *end* More on that later The mysterious Watchtower Society and its founder Charles Taze
Russell will serve as perhaps the most used example in this book of an organization that is secretly
serving the New World Order *end* The reader will be presented with the history of all this throughout the
book especially in chapters - of the first section *end* Chapter   *end* will go into more details on what
circumstantial evidence there is that might lead one to believe that Charles T *end* Russell was a Satanist *end* The author is aware that there are Jehovah’s Witnesses that are covert Satanists *end* The Russell family
appears to have moved from Germany to Scotland and from Scotland to northern Ireland *end* In the
’s Alexander G *end* Russell went to New York City and then onto Orange Co *end* NY *end* He could write
firsthand how good it was *end* When the Potato famine hit during the s the Russells did not have the
roots to Ireland that the original Irish had and the rest of the family moved to America except for
Fannie’s husband Alexander Harper who stayed behind in Donegal estranged from his wife *end* The
family tree looked like this

Picture missing

Let’s comment about the type of Russells that keep appearing throughout the course of the history of
the New World Order as this author went about his research *end* To summarize these various Russells
who until the genealogy work is done to show the connections should be viewed as individuals -- not
a group have been prominent members of the Illuminati the Masons the Fabians the Mormons the
Jehovah’s Witnesses the Jesuits the Royal Society and the Media controlled by those of the New
World Order and a deputy chairman of the Federal Reserve *end* Typically they have been merchants and
lawyers with a fair share of them also as Christian heretics *end* It will be easier perhaps to illustrate how
the Russells keep popping up in the New World Order story line by listing a good sampling of them *end*

QUESTIONING OLD ASSUMPTIONS

There was enough circumstantial evidence to lead one to question several assumptions *end* I began to
question the assumption that the W *end* T *end* presidents were unconnected to each other *end* Another
supposition that was questionable was that the WT Society did not have a hidden agenda *end*
C.T *end* RUSSELL’S STORY

Once there was a Jewish family whose name was Roessel *end* They lived in early  century Germany *end* They moved to a country called Scotland *end* There they re-spelled the name Russell *end* They took on the
ways of their new homeland *end* The English tried to settle Protestants from Scotland in Ireland in order
to control the Irish *end* When the opportunity opened up to go to the Emerald Island Ireland with the
Scottish settlers who went to the plantation Ulster they went *end* It is possible but not known for sure
that they learned to know the Rutherfords either in Scotland or Ireland *end* Scotland repeatedly appears
as the source of much of the religious heresy connected with the Power *end* That C  *end* T *end* Russell’s family
were in Scotland for a period and also from the German states which seem to be a hot bed for Jewish
Satanism may be only a coincidence and then again it might be a clue to understanding the origin of
the Watchtower Society *end* This Author’s previous book The Watchtower and the Masons tells the story
how the Arian heresy began at the University of Edinburgh Scotland and spread to the the
Presbyterians of the Synod of Ulster *end* The book gives this Author’s reasons for believing that the C  *end* T *end* Russell’s family in northern Ireland were Arian in belief before coming to the U *end* S *end* and chances
are they were involved with Freemasonry also *end*


THE ACKLEY CONNECTION

In The Watchtower and the Masons the early history of C  *end* T *end* Russell is given *end* Charles and his father
married two Ackley sisters a number of years after Charles’ mother died *end* What is an intriguing item is
that C  *end* T *end* Russell’s mother’s will indicates she owned land in Iowa *end* A description of that land shows
it was north of the town of Ackley Iowa *end* It turns out that a man named William Ackley had
purchased the land in that area and had sold it in large part to Scot-Irish settlers of the Presbyterian
faith as they were coming to America *end* At the time C T *end* Russell’s mother died a town named Ackley
had been staked out in  but the Civil War had interferred with construction plans *end* A Presbyterian
congregation had been formed in the area during the early s in the Ackley area which indicates
some settlers had arrived *end* What connection did the Russells have with the Ackleys years before
Charles T *end* and his father married Ackley sisters *end* Who are the Ackleys *end* Maria Ackley who was
Charles T *end* Russell’s wife was well-educated and an excellent writer *end* Interestingly in the
century she believed a socialist revolution was coming *end* She wrote "This great revolution has not yet
come but where is the statesman or the intelligent citizen that does not see it coming?" Russell
Maria *end* This Gospel of The Kingdom p *end*  *end* She was the ghost writer and ghost editor for much of
her husband Charles Taze ‘work *end* Her family was well-off *end* William Ackley the land
speculator/seller in Iowa traces his ancestry back to Prence Doane and Elizabeth Godfrey *end* Elizabeth
Godfrey in turn was the great-granddaughter of William Brewster of the Mayflower fame *end* The
Ackleys were Puritans to begin with and seem to have been concentrated in the Connecticut area and
from there their family members moved out into NY and PA *end* Another Ackley - at that
time was Richard Thomas Ackley a Freemason who worked for the Miller Russell and Company
store in Salt Lake City in  soon after the Mormons built Salt Lake City *end*
LEADS

Of course these are all simply tantalizing leads for the investigator but nothing solid *end* There seems to
be much more to Charles Taze RusseU than the little that the public has been told *end* In the next few
chapters we will attempt to dispel some of the mystery surrounding the man *end*
God’s "Annointed Seed"

In  the Joseph Lyttle Russell family had a baby who they gave the same name to as his uncle
had *end* This baby named Charles Taze Russell had a brother Frank who was two years older but
Charles ended up the favorite of his father *end* Later Charles would get a sister Margaret M *end* Both Charles
T *end* and his sister Margaret spoke on various occasions that his had been chosen before his birth for the
work that he was to carry out *end* Margaret referred to her brother as the greatest man alive "a giant
unmatched." She stated that he had been choosen for his religious work before his birth *end* Perhaps
Charles’ Russell family and his father Joseph L *end* like Joseph Kennedy who had goals for his son to
be president had goals for Charles *end* If Charles had been encouraged to meet such expectations and
had gone forward then that could account for his sister’s great admiration for him *end* He had fulfilled
her father’s wishes *end* At the Put-In-Bay Convention his sister Margaret had outlined how God planned
and chose her brother *end* First God had planted a seed with the early church *end* But the seed had laid
dormant for centuries *end* "In due time" she says the seed of truth grew and was watered according to
God’s plan *end* During the Dark Ages the seed of truth was barely kept alive waiting for God’s Chosen
One to bring it to fruition *end* When it was time God "annointed the eyes" of her brother at age  and
"God’s smile of favor rested upon him." Margaret said her brother was the one the faithful one who
God could depend upon the "one despite the burden and heat of the day" would remain faithful to
God *end*

MORIAH & THE MORMON LEADERSHIP

THE TOP  FAMILIES & THE MORMON LEADERSHIP

Rather than having an article this time about an individual family-and we will return later to our
articles on the  top families Lord willing -this article is an article about the  families in general *end*
CONTENT

In the first part of this article we will deal with actual people *end* In the second part of this article we will
discuss some about the top secret inner workings of the Satanic religion that the top  Illuminati
families participate in *end*
PART  *end*
One of the thlnp that the Illuminati has done is instill apathy in people toward resisting their
wickedness *end* A letter by an ex-Mormon says it better than I could

"There are many reasons why these people Mormons will not come forth even though they know of
the corruption in the Mormon church *end* One is due to their belief in Mormon scripture which they
associate with the Mormon church *end* The leadership has usurped power and authority over this
scripture *end* Thus the members of the Mormon church think that God expects them to support their
misguided leaders *end* This is much the - rationalization that many Americans make about our
government *end* They all know of the corruption but rationalize that it is unpatriotic to talk against the
government or ungrateful to complain when they enjoy superficial prosperity."

It is interesting that this Mormon recognizes that the process of the common man’s reaction is the
same to both Mormon and American leadership because as we will discuss the top leadership in both
the reader will learn they are related to each other and both under the control of the Top  *end* Illuminati
families *end*


THE MORMON LEADERS & THE Th TOP ILLUMINATI BLOODLINE

The Mormon president Ezra Taft Benson considered a prophet by Mormons was a fan of the John
Birch Society *end* Most people who have not read my exposes on both the Mormon Church and the John
Birch Society will not be able to protect themselves from the Illuminati *end* I don’t expose these
organizations without a great deal of proof *end* I say this because I know from too many sources and too
many angles that both organizations were initiated and have been run by the Illuminati *end* The Mormon
church has long prophesled that they would defend the US *end* Constitution in the last days *end* They are
moving to fulfill that with men like Bo Gritz who sprinkles has talks with buzz words from Mormon
prophecy *end* The John Birch Society was part of the process of the Hegelian dialectics of the cold war *end* They pretend to be the defenders of the people against the New World Order but they are fake
opposition *end* I have met quite a few John Birchers and so far although they claim to be against the
New World Order they want nothing to do with me or to learn anything  might share with them *end* I
can understand the leadership doing this to me but somehow the rank and file have picked up on
some of the attitudes of the leadership *end* I don’t know how the JBS has managed to do that but the
antagonistic attitudes that they have instilled in their people toward people like myself are amazing *end* In my Be Wise As Serpents book I gave the genealogical evidence to show that the Mormon
leadership connected to the  top illuminati family the Holy Blood line of what purports to be
Jesus’s lineage *end* I’ve also showed numerous other connections between the Mormon leaders and the
elite Illuminati bloodlines *end* Ezra Taft Benson’s genealogy helps tie together some of the various parts
of the Illuminati beast *end* The Taft is Heusen’s name is because Ezra Taft Benson is a descendent of
Alphonso Taft who along with one of the Russell family Russells are one of the top  families
William IL Russell started the Order of the Skull and Bones legally it has been known as Russell
Trust *end* Remember that George Bush was a Skull & Bonesman *end* George Bush also is a descendent of
the  top Illuminati family -the family that ties in with British royalty and the Merovingians *end* The
man who just beat George Bush in the Presidential race William Jefferson Blythe Clinton is a
descendent of some Russells *end*
PRESIDENT CLINTON

This newsletter hasn’t gotten to an individual article on the Russell family but they go way back in
the Illuminati *end* The Russell’s are responsible for starting the Skull & Bones Order the Pilgrim
Society the Watchtower Bible & Tract Society and the Masonic Daughters of Isabella DOI *end* Archibald D *end* Russell - a Mason from Scotiand set up still other organizations *end* Scotland
has played a key role in the Illuminati *end* One example of thousands is Marriner S *end* Eccles - Gov *end* of the
Fed *end* Reserve Board & supporter of FDR who is member of the wealthy Mormon Illuminati Eccles
family which came over from Scotland *end* The Russells played a key role in the opium trade in the
early s and early Mormonism *end* One of the Russell business partners was Warren Delano Jr *end* chief of Russell and Company operations in Canton China *end* Delano was the grandfather of Pres *end* Franklin Roosevelt *end* The Russell and Company logo was a Skull and Bones *end* The Taft family which is
also related to George Bush by blood and the Harriman family are two families that have been
intimately connected to the Skull and Bones Order which is an entry point into the Iliuminati and on
the surface just an exclusive fraternity *end*
‘Note Since this was written Bo Gritz and the Mormon church have gone separate ways *end* Bo Gritz
under the direction of his CIA handier has been moving around talking to Patriots and establishing a
community called ‘Almost Heaven’ near Kamiah ID *end* Fritz’s newsletters have had several articles
about Bo Gritz including one entitled S.P.I.K.E *end* which is what Bo calls the training he is giving
people.’

The Harriman family is also very prominent in Pres *end* Bill Clinton’s life *end* Averell Harriman was the
CEO of George Bush’s father’s company *end* Averell Harriman’s wife was Pamela who has played an
extremely important part in Bill Clinton’s life *end* Pamela Harriman raised more money for the
Democratic Party than any other single person Newsweek // *end* She created a political action



committee nicknamed PAM PAC *end* When Bill Clinton lost his race for governor Pamela made BIB
Clinton head chairman of her PAM PAC *end* It took Brian Quig a Christian researcher like myself to
expose the connections between BIll Clinton and Pamela Harriman *end* Can you guess why the
establishment media somehow carefully kept theIr relationship secret *end* When Bill Clinton was a high
schooler he shook hands with President John F *end* Kennedy a member of one of the Top  Illuminati
Bloodlines-see // Newsletter *end* The master of ceremonies at the affair where JFK and Clinton
met was Winthrop Rockefeller another member of a Top  Illuminati family and at the time
Governor of New York *end* In the film clips of this event which the establishment media have used
recently the establishment media edited out Winthrop Rockefeller from the scenes of Clinton and
JFK *end* Now why do you think they did that *end* The Astor family one of the top  famIlies was
intimately connected to the creation of the Rhodes Scholarship *end* See // newsletter on the Astor
family *end* Clinton was a Rhodes Scholar and looked upto Prof *end* Carroll Quigley the archivist of the
CFR as a mentor *end* The Quigley-Clinton connection introduces more connections between Clinton and
the Illuminati *end* Quigley side-tracked people by making people think the elite were Anglophiles who
wanted the British to rule the world *end* Although the elite are partial to the English language as a lingua-
franca in their heart their allegiance is not to Britain but to Satan *end* Clinton has been compared to JFK
& FDR by people perhaps in a negative sense the comparison is appropriate *end* LET’S REVIEW some
of the Items which STUCK OUT AS RED FLAGS TO ME ABOUT BILL CLINTON

- Several ex-witches now Christians identified Clinton’s running mate Al Gore as switch *end* Al Gore’s
book promotes several witchcraft themes such as Mother Gain worship *end* Senator Al Gore has
intimately worked with other men who are Illuminati for years *end* Al Gore was close friends with
Armand Hammer the Illuminati courier who shuttled back and forth between Moscow and America
on a regular basis and had homes in both countries *end* Hammer bankrolled both Al Gore Jr *end* and his
father Al Gore Sr *end*
- Al Gore and Bill Clinton raised their hands at the Democratic National Convention and declared that
their administration would be the "New Covenant." Bill Clinton’s brother ended up in prison in
connection to the illegal drug trade that I know that Bill Clinton was also involved with helping while
he was Governor of Arkansas *end* Readers of this newsletter are aware that the top Illuminati families are
the power behind the drug trade *end* See previous newsletter // p *end*  about some of Bill’s role in
Arkansas with the drug trade *end*
- Bill Clinton’s chief campaign advisor James Carville is pictured in People’s Magazine *end* p *end* wearing
a pentagram in the middle of his forehead *end*
- Bill Clinton calls his first press conference as President *end* elect according to the astrologically correct
full-moon day *end*
- Bill Clinton in his inaugural speech said "This ceremony is held in the depth of winter *end* But by the
words we speak and the faces we show the world we force the spring.’ Clinton repeated the words
‘we force the spring’ later in the speech *end* That expression is a very unusual expression *end* To ‘force the
spring" is witchcraft language *end* in witchcraft and satanism Lucifer Baal rises from the underworld on
May st also known by the following list of names Beltaine a major European holiday Communism
and the Illuminati’s chief holiday and Walpurgis *end* The May st rising brings forth the season of
fertility which the witches each year take credit for by claiming that their magic rituals ‘force the
spring.’ The ritual magic that ‘forces the spring’ is done on  Sabbats-the first is Imbolg also known
by names Candiemas by the Catholics and Ground Hog Day by common dupes; the second is the
vernal equinox Mar *end*  in which blood and sex rituals are carried out and the third is Beltaine May
 in which fire festivals are done *end* This is one of the fire festivals which people around the United
States tell me they have witnessed from a distance *end* Witches believe that on May st the female force
completes her takeover from the male force *end* There are  cabinet members which when they
assemble with their head BIll Clinton make the number  *end* Bill Clinton choose ‘to force the spring’
with his ‘cabinet coven.’ In true witchcraft tradition the Cabinet of Bill Clinton followed the pattern
of ‘forcing the Spring.’ In order for the female to overtake the male force Clinton chose the position
of Attorney General *end* The title ‘General’ has a male connotation *end* All the rest of the cabinet members



are called Secretaries which has a female connotation *end* The Attorney General posItion was to be given
to a woman *end* But in order for the witchcraft ceremony and timing to be right the woman couldn’t take
over until after Feb *end*  or Imbolg and there had to be  female candidates from which one is
traditionally picked by a witchcraft coven *end* This is why the selection of the Attorney General was not
confirmed until Feb *end*  *end* And sure enough all three candidates given by Bill Clinton were women from
which one was selected *end* Bill Clinton did indeed ‘force the spring’ *end* Further Clinton gave told us
HOW he would ‘force the spring’ in his inaugural speech *end* On the  word of his inauguration
speech Clinton launched into a sentence on sacrifice ‘it will not be easy; it will require sacrifice *end* But
it can be done and done fairly not choosing sacrifice for Its own sake but for our own sake.’ Clinton
gave the hand signal of Satanists at the end of his speech *end* See previous newsletters this year *end* And
Newsweek Magazine headlined its story ‘New Age President Takes Office.’ Jan *end*  ’ That
Clinton would consider his Cabinet a coven is not so far fetched *end* Most of his cabinet tie in closely
with the Illuminati *end* The Council on Foreign Relations is an upper level of the visible arm of the
Illuminati *end* The Jan *end* ‘ newsletter explained that the CFR was the equivalent of the ° of the
Bavarian Illuminati *end* Note that many of these people do not realize the full Satanic implications of
what they are in *end* If one reviews the various levels of the Bavarian Illuminati you will realize that the
process of corruption was gradual and that the lower levels had no idea what they were really
involved in although some probably suspected what they were into *end* The basic ingredient of the lower
levels is loyalty to their superiors because they believe they are in the elite’s organization *end* Consider
Clinton and his cabinet Slick Willie Clinton — CFR TC Trilateral Commission Bldrbgr
Bilderberger participant participant in various Illuminati front organizations such as DLC Rhodes
Scholar wife Hillary is known to practice shamanism witchcraft *end*
Treasury Secretary - Lloyd Bentsen -- Bldrbgr ex-CFR connected to S&L scandal henchman for the
Illuminati *end*
Secretary of Health & Human Services—Donna Shalala- CFR TC close friend of Hillary Clinton *end*
Secretary of Defense—Les Aspin--CFR Socialist Les Aspin chose for his top assistant the pro-
communist Jew Morton Halperin *end* Halperln was also a  of the ACLU and worked loyally for
Henry Kissinger at the National Security Council *end*
Secretary of State—Warren Christopher--CFR

Secretary of the Interior - Bruce Babbitt — CFR he has been involved in various activities for the
elite *end*
Secretary of Labor—Robert Reich -- a Zionist Jew over % of Clinton’s major appointees were
Zionist Jews strange considering Jews only make up % of the population

Attorney General — Janet Reno -- murderer of innocent people at Waco TX *end* The people at Waco
believed that they were the true Jews and flew the Jewish flag at Waco notice that Reno who is
Jewish and was on the board of directors of the Jewish Illuminati Terrorist organization of the Anti-
Defamation League could not stand the idea of Christians believing that they are the true Jews *end*
Secretary of Housing & Urban Development - Henry Cisveros - CFR

Secretary of Education - Richard W *end* Riley - participant at Renaissance Weekend

I think the readers get the picture *end* I had a list of which ones were known to be gay but I can’t find
it *end* A number of Clinton’s high appointees are homosexuals *end* There is a high correlation between
homosexuality and the occult and also a big correlation between the type of ‘Jews’ Clinton has
chosen and Satanism *end* Historically some of the most rabid anti-Christians are Satanists from Jewish
backgrounds *end*
- During the inauguration week witches homosexuals and homosexual witches gathered at the White
House for various celebrations to perform to hold rituals and other events *end* These people were



invited by the President for various things *end* Clearly those who are known publicly as a witch or a
homosexual are considered honorable by the President *end*
WHAT IS THE SPIRITUAL SIGNIFICANCE OF ThE CLINTONS *end*
The answer to this can be found in my very first newsletter back in  *end* Whenever YHVH God has
raised up prophets like Elijah to turn the people back to God and morality Satan has sent out the
Jezebel spirit *end* Along with the Jezebel spirit goes the Ahab spirit *end* Hillary and Bill fit the Jezebel and
Ahab spirit exactly *end* I remember personally when I heard several prophets of God warn about the
Jezebel spirit *end* I thought this sounds rather strange *end* I had never heard about it before *end* Soon I began
telling people in the church I was attending about the NWO and to function in a small way
prophetically and the Jezebel spirit came into that church *end* The church had been happy with their
elders but after I began to warn the people about the NWO a constant clamor was heard every
sunday for the church to select women as elders *end* This church had a long history without believing in
women elders and it had never been an issue *end* Unless one is aware of the connection between the
Jezebel spirit and the Elijah type of prophet and knows the full orb of what the Jezebel spirit is it is
not likely that a person would notice the connection between the two *end* Baal worship was simply an
ancient form of Satanism *end* Jezebel was the daughter of King Ethbaal of Tyre who was an ardent Baal
worshipper *end* Jezebel was a Satanic High Priestess a real witch *end* She had  prophets of Baal and
prophets of the groves *end* She put the true ministers of God to death *end* Her husband used his political
office as she directed to further the power of darkness *end* We are simply now seeing history repeat itself *end*
PART  *end*
In this part we will explain sealing rituals *end* I am doing this so that Christians can understand who a
Keeper of Seals is and also so that Christians can understand that Mormonism is closer to Satanism
than it is to Christianity *end* This article will hopefully provide a written record so that Christians have an
objective way to determine If someone who claims to be an ex-Satanist really is *end* I realize that some
Christians don’t like to learn about their enemy and that is fine if they do not want to read this *end* On
the other hand I see people who are coming out of Satanism who the Christians are disbelleving *end* The
Christians have no reference from which to determine whether someone is legitimate or not *end* And
although I believe the Spirit of God is an excellent revealer of men I have to be frank even the best
of Christians sometimes don’t hear what the Spirit has to say and could benefit from a written
explanation *end* The closest descriptions of sealing rituals that I have found that matches the descriptions
of satanic hierarchy rituais from people who have come out of the Satanic Hierarchy are the Mormon
sealing rituals *end* For anyone wanting to do a study about how Mormonism is witchcraft I sust they
read the scholariy book written by a Mormon scholar Early Mormonism and the Magic World View
by D *end* Michael Quinn *end* Quinn conclusively shows that early Mormonism was based on magic and
witchcraft *end* Quinn who is a Mormon in good standing tries to point out in the book that these things
can’t be held against Mormonism because most every one back in the early s practiced magic
and witchcraft *end* Whether most people did or not seems to me to be irrelevant as to whether it is O.K *end* Another great book showing the connections between the Mormon Temple ceremonies Witchcraft
rituals and Masonic rituals is Bill Schnoebelen’s book Mormonism Temple of Doom *end* Bill does an
excellent job of showing and illustrating how the Mormon temple ceremony Masonic and Witchcraft
rituals are simply the very same thing with minor variations *end* One of the most important things in
satanism is sealing *end* Everything is sealed *end* One doesn’t hear the term sealing used a lot *end* I have read
many books of the enemy to know how he thinks and it is rare to have someone mention sealing *end* I
had to learn about it from ex-Satanists *end* If one leaves off studying Satanism and begins studying the
many cults and religions one begins hearing about sealing again when one gets to Mormonism *end* Mormon men and women contrary to Lk  are sealed to each other in the Mormon temple
marriages *end* The early Mormons were sealed to many spouses *end* The Mormon sealing is very simllar to
what is done in witchcraft called handfasting and it is also similar to marriage sealing in Satanism *end* Joseph Smith whose famlly practiced witchcraft had many types of seals around their house which
were used in magic *end* According to a magic book of  "Demonology and Witchcraft" by Walter
Scott pp *end*  - seer stones were to be anointed with oil and sealed with holy characters *end* In
 Mormon leaders performed such a magical sealing for James Cohn Brewster *end* Mormonism and



the Magic World View *end* p.- Joseph Smith had a cane with a serpent on the top of it and
astrological seals below *end* Magick staff or canes are important in Satanism *end* The seal of Mars was
carved on the Smith family athame which was used by the family to draw circles for magic
incantations *end* Mormonism & the Magic World View p *end*  In  a ritual done by Joseph Smith
to commune with a spirit messenger is recorder by Oliver Cowdery *end* Joseph Smith used two Seals of
the Earth to conjure up the spirit *end* Ibid p *end*  Smith’s ritual was in accordance with the best occult
guidebooks then The Book of Knowledge and Barrett’s Magus *end*
The  edition of the Book of Mormon says that about itself ‘.. *end* their voice shall be as one that hath
a familiar spirit .. *end* They shall write the things which shall be done among them and they shall be
written and sealed up in a book.’  Nephi - *end* The Mormon scholar Quinn writes ‘The Book
of Mormon’s use of the word ‘sealed’ also suggested a magic context *end* Isaiah  uses the word
‘sealed’ only twice but the Book of Mormon’s commentary on the chapter uses ‘sealed’ eleven times
in eight verses  Ne ;  Ne - .. *end* Throughout the entire text the Book of Mormon refers to
itself with the words ‘sealed’ or ‘seal’ more than twenty times . *end* Modern Mormons have often
pictured a physical seal .. *end* but the Book of Mormon nowhere describes a physical seal evoking
instead the seal as a non-material restriction ‘For the book shall be sealed by the power of God.’
Ne phi  Quinn goes on to describe more about the magical sealing of the Book of Mormon *end*
’ Masonic leader Manly P *end* Hail in his book on Masonic symbolop describes a seal involved with
black magic and the Pact that is made with a conjured demon in a section entitled ‘Modus Operandi
for the Invocation of Spirits’ on p *end* CIII *end* Within both the Generational Satanic covens and the covens
made up of recruits to Satanism there is the office of Keeper of Seals *end* The Keepers of Seals show the
importance of sealing to Satanism *end* Almost everything done in Satanism involves sealing *end* There are
many vows that are made and there are always exchanges made during these vows and then a
sealing *end* In the exchanges there is always something lost by each person *end* Satanic Hierarchy
individuals are sealed to others and the part of a Satanist that is put into another is magically infused *end* In one ritual there is a black stone with the Satanist’s name written on it that is given to the Queen
Mother *end* See the chart // newsletter to understand this high rank *end* By giving something of
oneself that item supposedly gives magical power to the person you have vowed before *end* If you break
your vow they can take the item you have given and work destructive magic against you *end* In the
Satanic Hierarchy they have a Moonchild ceremony where they demonize the fetus while in the
womb *end* In the AntiChrist ceremony the item that is exchange with Satan for a woman’s vow to Satan
is to sacrifice her child *end* Then of course this vow is sealed *end* The Keepers of Seals hold the books full of
written pacts and the items exchanged in all these countless rituals *end*
DOES THE SATANIC HIERARCHY HAVE TESLA’S INVENTION *end*
A Mother of Light said ‘Power is a transitory experience.. *end* it is very conditioned upon the myths you
are in *end* It is important that the person knows the myth be is in *end*
He must have a feeling for it ....The tangible can become the intangible.’ I’ll leave the reader puzzled
how I got this quote from a Mother of Light but the idea of the tangible becoming the intangible is an
interesting idea because of two reasons *end* First the United States Navy is reported to have found out in
W.W.II in the Philadelphia experiment how to electronically make a force field around something
that makes the object invisible *end* However the experiment proved to be very dangerous and it took
them years before the technology could be applied to something safely *end* This technology is being used
on the Stealth bomber *end* to make them both invisible to radar and to human sight *end* The second reason is
that an ex-Illuminati member states that an experimental box the size of a breadbox with controls was
being used by the coven to make people invisible *end* The people had to stay where they were they could
not move around but they were somehow made invisible by the box where they were standing *end*
Likewise those who want to believe that Clinton is a nice guy that he isn’t working as a lackey of the
Illuminati go ahead and believe these lies God will even send you a strong delusion to allow you to
believe these lies *end* But those who love the truth and are tired of being lied to and want answers as to
why things are happening like they are will not accept the surface explanations that cover the



debauchery of Satanists *end* Instead of getting upset that someone like myself is showing you the double
meaning behind Clinton’s hand signal--people should be upset that an attempt was made to trick them
by Clinton *end* The Christian people have been told by several Christians and I could name names but I
won’t that Clinton is going to lead this nation into righteousness *end* God’s people perish for lack of
knowledge *end* The fact is that if Clinton really came to Christ and really began leading the people
toward righteousness which he doesn’t even now lead the people-the people who put him in office
do the real leading then the hierarchy would kill him *end* Christians are always saying we need to pray
for our leaders--fine pray for them they need to find God just realize Clinton is not one of our real
leaders he is way down on the totem pole and is simply a shoe-shine boy for the hierarchy *end* Maybe
the Christian people ought to learn who really leads them so they can pray better *end* Bush was a heavy-
weight for the Illuminati and he was picked by the Illuminati originally as their first choice to win *end* That was before the primaries *end* Of course all the final presidential candidates Bush Perot and Clinton
and maybe some of the others too *end* were Illuminati men *end* It was a choice on their part who they
wanted *end* Bush apparently antagonized the Rothschilds and Clinton was placed into power to appease
those who were upset with Bush *end* That the elite decided to change from Bush to Clinton became
visible in Sept *end* and in October I notified my readers that the change of choice had occured *end* Supposedly Bush had mishandled something that hurt the Rothschilds financially but whatever
happened it is clear that behind the scenes some big events happened *end* Clinton was close friends of
Winthrop Rockefeller when he moved to Arkansas *end* Winthrop Rockefeller gave Clinton over
million dollars *end* In return Clinton was in his pocket *end* It has been well worth Clinton’s time to serve the
Illuminati kings *end* So good in fact that Ace Hayes may be correct when he claims that he has
information showing that Clinton owns  *end* billion in treasury bonds *end* If so then it is understandable
that Clinton would want taxes collected *end* I had hoped that my photo of Clinton giving the Satanic
signal at the inauguration would be finished by now *end* It isn’t but I will go ahead with this article *end* Since coming out with my Mar *end*   newsletter I have found out that Texe Marrs came out with a
photo showing Clinton’s satanic signalling at the inauguration *end* People need to spiritiually discern
what Clinton is all about *end*
Clinton gave a speech before becoming president that insiders" would have no place in his
administration *end* If people study the situation he appointments have all been insiders *end* This is just one
example of many that show that the words Clinton speaks are simply the words that the American
people want to hear *end* "Slick Willie" is an appropriate name for this President has absolutely no
integrity nor honesty *end* And yet I am hearing people in the churches that want to believe in Clinton *end* It’s
sad to say they want this because God will send them a strong delusion to believe the lies they want
to believe in *end* Federico Pena is our new Clinton-appointed Secretary of Transportation *end* If he treats the
country like he treated Denver watch out *end* Pena got the new Denver International Airport project
continued against all logic *end* John Coleman’s WIR brings out in his newsletter the details about how
Pena’s airport project and many other projects he sponsored are white elephants that are not what the
public needs but simply white elephants that help line the pockets of the rich *end* Those of you who
don’t take Texe Marrs’ newsletter may find it interesting that Bill Clinton has ties to the Jesuits *end* Of
course I take it for granted that people realize that Carroll Quigley was Clinton’s mentor *end* Carroll
Quigley was one of those intellectuals like H.G *end* Wells who believed in a New World Order and the
elite that wanted to bring it in *end* Let me digress and discuss men like H.G *end* Wells and Carroll Quigley *end* These men believed that the west should lead the world into a New World Order *end* I suggest that
people should read H.G *end* Wells’ book The New World Order  and his The Open Conspiracy
 *end* Another good book to understand what the elite have planned is Manly P *end* Hall’s book Facing
the Future *end* Oswald Spengler also has a good book to read The Hour of Decision *end* The last few
chapters of Lionel Curtess’s World Order  also is good in explaining how they want a world
commonwealth of states *end* People like Clinton were feed this type of stuff *end* But there is a much greater
hidden agenda *end* Manly P *end* Hall for instance was part of Lucis Trust as was late leader of the Scottish
Rite Freemasons as well as Rockefeller *end* Lucis Trust’s External isation of the Hierarchy tells us what
the agenda is *end* The agenda is to externalize the Satanic Hierarchy and on page  of Externalisation
of the Hierarchy it tells us who will rule the world on the earthly plane--his name is Lucifer *end* And on
the Spiritual level shambala it will be the Lord of the World Sanat *end* We Christians know the Lord of
the World not as Sanat but as Satan *end* It’s all down in black and white on page  *end* Greed and material



wealth play such an important part in the lives of all these people who Satan has inspired to help
dream up schemes for a New World Order *end* Therefore most of these people see economics as an
important vehicle for creating a New World Order *end* But there is a hidden agenda *end* The conspiracy is
not an economic conspiracy nor a political conspiracy but as The Externalisation of the Hierarchy
reveals in page after page--their conspiracy is a religious conspiracy *end* People lets just lay it out on the
line--Clinton is a Satanist he knows what the hidden agenda is *end* It’s an eyeopener to read the books I
listed by Wells Hall and Spengler but believe me that stuff is just for the blind intellectuals *end* The real
details of this New World Order have been written down in detail and they came directly from the
Master of Evil himself directly from Satan to his hierarchy who copied the plans in detail *end* The
people who will implement the New World Order are men like Clinton *end* Men who have no moral
code *end* Men who will glibly tell one lie after another *end* They won’t implement H.G *end* Well’s plan---they
will implement Satan’s plan *end* And prideful Satan will unwittingly implement YHWH God’s *end*


Bloodlines of Illuminati

By

Fritz Springmeier

Once again I have opened up my files of research and tried to investigate the Satanic Hierarchy *end* Sometimes in doing investigation one turns down a dead end *end* I hope I haven’t done that *end* There does
seem to be a strong Dutch connection to the Illuminati and the Van Duyn family might be one of the
keys to understanding that Dutch connection *end* My investigation with Van Duyn family is the only
family that has left me without any solid facts that would place them within the Top  Families *end* However because bloodlines are so important to the Hierarchy and because it is hard to really
investigate these families without understanding their genealogies I have made the effort to give you
a genealogy of Van Duyns that may have some importance *end*
THE VAN DUYN BLOODLINE *end*
In  Peter Minuit traded some trinkets to the Canarsie Indians to purchase Manhattan Island *end* The
history books like to report the value of the trinkets as  *end* The purchase was supposedly a good deal
for the Dutch *end* The Canarsie Indians didn’t own Manhattan Island it belonged to other Indians so it is
debatable who got the best deal that day *end* That was the beginning of the Dutch colony of New
Netherlands and its capital New Amsterdam built beside Ft *end* Amsterdam all three later renamed
New York *end* The Van Duyn family also spelled Van Dien Van Duyne et *end* al *end* was one of the Dutch
families to come over to the Dutch colony of New Netherlands which was connected to the Dutch
West India Company *end* Other early important New Netherlands families from the Netherlands include
Van Sise Van Cleef also spelled Van Cleve and Van Cleave Van Coorn Van de Water Dooren
and Stoothoff *end* In  fifteen years before the British took New Netherlands from the Dutch Gerret
Cornellissen Van Duyn immigrated with his older sister from Brabant Netherlands Brabant is a
district so *end* of Eindhoven in southern Netherlands but at the time Van Duyn came over it included
Belgium *end* to New Amsterdam *end* This date is according to Claypool Edward A *end* Descendants of
Dennis Van Duyn and Alice Tunison Chicago IL *end* In contrast to this The National Cyclopaedia Vol *end*  *end* p *end*  states that he came over in  which is a mistake because that was his date of birth *end*
For some reason Gerret Cornelius Van Duyn returned to Holland to Zwolle on the east side of the
Zuider Zee although he had originally lived in Nieuwkerk in Zeeland before going to New
Netherlands America *end* Gerrit C *end* Van Duyn was a coarse non-spiritual ignorant man who did
carpenter work *end* His lack of interest in Christianity seems to have carried down through quite a
number of generations *end* After coming to the New World again he moved away from New Amsterdam
fairly quickly to New Utrecht *end* Now I believe that is where Greenwich Villiage is *end* In the long run his
descendants some related to the Castello family moved to Michigan Illinois Kansas and elsewhere *end* In the next century however his descendents moved and created  branches- one in Queens Co *end* NY;
one in Kings Co *end* NY; one in Dutchess Co *end* NY; a fourth in Somerset Co *end* NJ; and a fifth in Morris
Co *end* NJ *end* It is possible a few other Van Duyns also immigrated from the Netherlands to America;
information on the family is scarce *end* In Germany the privilege to use the title ‘von’ was a special noble
privilege *end* I believe the same applied in the Netherlands which would mean that the Van Duyns were
a prominent family when they came over *end* The low profile of the family didn’t end when they arrived
in the New World it continues *end* The extremely low profile of the Van Duyns makes one wonder if
they could really be one of the top  families *end* Still Mona Van Duyn was the first woman poet
laureate a Pulitzer winner  and got a good review of her book in  by the I have found that
such awards take a combination of both talent and pull especially in a field as subjective as poetry it
helps to have pull *end* Where did Mona Van Duyn get the political pull to get so many awards and many
well promoted poetry books *end* Even before the British had consolidated their hold on New Netherlands
the area was giving a foreshadowing of what it would become *end* Pirates which raided the East Indies
and the Red Sea were outfitted in what is today New York and Rhode Island *end* William Patterson born



c *end*  in Scotland was the evil genius behind the establishment of the Bank of Engiand *end* It is
strongly believed that he was a trader in New York in - and that prior to this he had worked
with the pirate Morgan who operated in the New Netherlands area *end* Witchcraft was part of some
people’s lives in New Netherlands but the colony was far more lenient toward them than in the
Puritan colony in Massachusetts *end* The last Dutch governor of New Netherlands Gov *end* Peter
Stuyvesant’s sister-in-law was suspected of witchcraft but acquitted *end* Ralph Hall of Seatalcott Long
Island and his wife were the only ones seriously tried of witchcraft in New Amsterdam and they were
acquitted *end* In  the British had taken the New Netherlands from the Dutch for the second and final
time and they made the Dutch take an oath of allegiance to the British Crown *end* Three Van Duyns of
New Amsterdam are recorded having taken that oath *end* They were Gerrit Cornelis Van Duyn Cornelis
Gems Vanduyn and Denijs Gerrise Vanduyn *end* However in the  census taken in New York state
there are no Van Duyn families at all listed *end* One of the best books on the Van Duyn family is New
Netherlands Families by Wilson V *end* Ledley Vol *end*  which is about the Van Duyn family *end* I obtained a
copy of the Van Duyn part which was able to assist me in my genealogy work *end* I count  Van
Duyn’s in the fifth generation of Van Duyn’s in this country *end* Some of the families that the Van
Duyn’s have intermarried with are Ailing Allen Brendel Bullinger Graeber Hayes Kennedy and
Robertson *end* Some of the other families which are definitely Dutch with which the family married with
are the Van Burens the Van Cleeves and Van der Hoef *end* It would be exceedingly interesting to find
out if the Van Duyn’s connect at all with the Dutch King William of Orange or some of William of
Orange’s supporters *end* Many of today’s elite trace back to William of Orange or his prominent
supporters *end* The Van Duyn last name has ended up with many spellings *end* For instance in Bergen Co *end* NJ *end* the name is spelled Van Dyne Van Duyn VanDuyne Van Dine VanDine & Van Dien *end* An
informer states that Van Duyn is one of the top  Illuminati families *end* If that is so then it certainly is
the least known family of the thirteen *end* This article will show clues and evidence that have kept me
from rejecting the possibility that the family is indeed one of the top thirteen *end* On the other hand there
are also some very puzzling things about this family that almost disqualify it from being a top family *end* One puzzling thing is how rare this surname is *end* Considering that the name belonged to one of the
earliest settlers in the New World one would expect quite a clan to have developed *end* But this is not so *end* Another puzzling thing is that the conspiracy has a great deal of activity going on in Brussels
Belgium *end* Belgium is half Dutch half french *end* Many of the people in Brussels have Dutch names and
it would be expected that if the Van Duyn family were a top family they would have someone in
Brussels but I wasn’t able to locate any there *end* See the reproduction of the Brussels phone book to
show that some places have been named after the Van Duyns but none live there although two Van
Duynens are listed *end*
VAN DUYNS THAT CAUGHT MY EYE

Historically there were a few Van Duyns that caught my attention *end*
Cornelis Van Duyn ---left an inheritance of  pounds of money to children *end*
William Van Duyn ---left two plantations to children in will

Aaron Van Duyn - --trustee & deacon of the Meth *end* Episcopal church

Alfred Voorhees Van Duyn -??--an undertaker of Middlebush NJ

Harrison Van Duyn ---member of NJ legislature in  became Speaker of the House in


Scottish and York Rite Freemason member of the Holland Society see Holland Society Yearbook
 and numerous other business organizations and societies *end*
Horace N *end* Van Duyn--Stockholder in the Boston National Bank

Lewis Van Duyn-- Surveyor organizer & president of Boonton Water Co *end* owned lots of real estate *end*


Simeon Van Duyn-- inventor member Meth *end* Church in Boonton

The Van Duyn name is known in Western United States because of Van Duyn chocolate candies *end* The
Van Duyn name has been well known in the New York area *end* The oldest of the large care centers for
the elderly in NY is named after a Van Duyn *end* It was founded in  at Syracuse NY Address is
West Seneca Turnpike *end*
This elderly care center the Van Duyn Home and Hospital was reported to have  total regular
staff  nurses and  licensed beds which are kept % occupied making it the largest *end* I have
very limited knowledge of the Van Duyn family *end* Three Van Duyn’s are worthy of mention at this
point *end* One Van Duyn was reported by an NSA informant to have been the liaison officer between
MI the CIA Mossad and the Vietnamese government during the s *end* Another Van Duyn was the
founder of a branch of Planned Parenthood an important New Age group which has been promoting
sterilations birth control abortions etc *end* for over half a century *end* The third is Mona Jane Van Duyn
who has authored several poetry books and is a Guggenheim fellow *end*


EDWARD SEGUIN VAN DUYN & PLANNED PARENTHOOD

Edward S *end* Van Duyn  -  was a prominent surgeon who was born in Syracuse NY *end* He
went to Princeton Univ *end* and then got his M.D *end* at Syracuse University in  *end* From  until
he was a surgeon *end* During the ghastly W.W *end* I be was in the U.S *end* Army Medical Corps in France first
as a major and then as a Lt *end*
Colonel *end* Edward S *end* Van Duyn attended the Unitarian Church during his life--a church which has long
been associated with Wicca *end* He also associated with the liberal Presbyterians *end* In  he founded
the Planned Parenthood Center of Syracuse New York *end* Planned Parenthood Federation of America
was an Illuminati inspired organization that was set up to accomplish several objectives *end* The
organization’s own stated purpose is very revealing "To provide leadership m making effective
means of voluntary fertility regulation including contraception abortion sterilization and infertility
services available and fully accessible to all as a central element of reproductive health; stimulating
and sponsoring relevant biomedical socioeconomic and demographic research; developing
appropriate information education and training programs to increase knowledge about human
reproduction and sexuality." Planned Parenthood Federation of America has about  affiliated
organizations and actively promotes its agenda all over the world *end* It operates about  centers in the
U.S *end* It maintains a  volume library on abortion sterilization and population control *end* One of its
leaders Alan F *end* Guttmacher signed the Humanist Manifesto and the president Faye Wattleton was
awarded "Humanist of the year" in  *end* Both hate Christians *end* Margaret Sanger who advocated neo-
Malthusian population controls with money from her husband and rich backers started the American
Birth Control League ABCL in  *end* The ABCL opened up the Birth Control Research Bureau
BCCRB in  *end* In  the ABCL and another similar group merged to form the Birth Control
Federation of America BCFA which in  changed its name to Planned Parenthood Federation *end* Consider the changes that have happened within our lifetimes *end* In  birth control devices were
outlawed in all NY metropolitan hospitals *end* In  the Federal government was subsidizing
abortions and birth control through the federal antipoverty program *end* In the s public schools
started offering condoms and new types of sex education programs for teenagers *end* The Schlesinger
Library has been actively keeping historical records of the "family planning movement" and David
Kennedy wrote the book Birth Control in America The Career of Margaret Sanger in  *end* Much of
what has happened in abortions birth control research and population control mechanisms has come
as a result of these type of organizations *end* I was curious-WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE WANT US
STERILIZED OUR BABIES ABORTED AND THE WORLD’S POPULATION REDUCED *end* What kind of people are funding the enormous amount of money it takes to get people to abort their
babies *end* What does it cost to get a population to voluntarily neuter themselves *end* I randomly picked a
year  to research the funding for Planned Parenthood and the Planned Parenthood branches *end* I
was astounded at how hugh the sums of money that the elite spend in just one year to get us to



castrate ourselves and tie our tubes and abort our babies *end* I have divided the list of Foundations that
donated money to Planned Parenthood in just the single year of  into two categories *end* The first
category are Foundations that I can identify having connections to the Illuminati *end* The others are all
the rest and I suspect this second group has many that tie back too I most likely haven’t figured out
how *end*

If the reader is wondering what happened that some of the other top Illuminati families are not on the
above list the reason why is that the other families were supporting other organizations similar to
Planned Parenthood Foundation which are also working to promote sterilizations abortions and
sexual promiscuity *end* For instance the Rockefeller family runs hundreds of foundations and just two of
these --the ones named after the Rockefellers-supported the following groups in  which have the
same goals and agenda as Planned Parenthood-- Center for Population Options donation given -
 Population Council  Alan Guttmacher Institute  this is a dangerous
organization doing research to promote these things Population Institute  *end* On top of this in
 the Red Chinese Academy of Medical Science was given several Rockefeller grants to do
contraceptive sterilization and genetic research *end* One of these was a  grant given to the Red
Chinese Academy of Medical Science to study male contraceptives *end* Has abortion sterilization sexual
promisculty population control and genetic research been part of the Illuminati’s long range plan *end* You bet *end* But it was important that the Illuminati convince the experts at least the experts they
control that these things were needed to save mankind *end* Three studies were made by the elite to
determine that a population explosion was threatening the earth *end* according to William Cooper in
Behold a Pale Horse pp *end* - *end* The first was during W.W *end* II the second at Huntsville AL in
and the third by the Club of Rome ending in  *end* All three studies concluded that population growth
must be curtailed *end* Last year at a meeting of the elite George Hunt obtained a handout which shows
that the elite are committed to stopping the population growth by any means available *end* Years earlier
Illuminatus Dr *end* Aurelio Peccei advocated a plague similar to the Black Plague and when the idea was
developed it became the AIDs epidemic *end* The Illuminati have the cure for AIDS *end* Actually there are
many cures for AIDS But the one they had before the AIDS epidemic began will not be given to the
population until enough people die or until the elite are exposed enough that they are forced to give
out the cure *end* Dr *end* Wolf Szmuness *end* Pope John Paul II’s ex-roomate was one of the masterminds behind
the AIDS epidemic *end* The National Security Council has had an ad hoc group on Population Policy to
strongly encourage other nations to have birth control abortions and sterilizations *end* This group
drafted the Global  Report which was given to Carter *end* Whether the population explosion is a
threat or not--having travelled world-wide and having a father who was considered one of the better
agricultural scientists I contend it is not a threat- -the world’s elite believe it and they make the
decisions *end* Further they have a vested interest an immoral need to believe in the overpopulation lie *end*


VAN DUYN CANDIES

Van Duyn Candies has its kitchen and administration at  N.E *end* Broadway Portland OR *end* They
operate  retail candy stores in Portland one in Silverdale WA near Bremerton *end* The  year old
company has  shopping mall leases and wholesales candy to other candy distributors *end* It also
operates a subsidiary Miss Saylor’s Candies Inc *end* of Long Beach CA *end* Van Duyn has in turn been
bought out by Van Rian Corp  NW Quimby St *end* Portland  *end* In  American
Confectionery Inc *end* of Chino CA was listed as owner of Van Duyn Candies *end* These statistics were
the ones I was able to get they may be outdated *end* One informant felt that Van Duyn Candies might
play a role in the distribution of poisoned candy to American school children which was an Illuminati
plan on the drawing boards years ago *end* I contacted a Van Duyn representative about any company
plans to distribute candy to schools but got no information *end* The company has had its share of strange
things happen *end* Richard McCall who was the president borrowed  of the company’s funds for
his personal use *end* This theft of company funds was forgiven when he gave up his position and his
share of stock so that he no longer had control over a large block of stock *end* On April   The
Oregonian reported that the company had gone bankrupt and had filed for bankruptcy in Mar *end*  *end* However *end* company officials declared that the bankruptcy was merely a reorganization which
involved the resolving of the equity split in financial control of the company *end* The Van Duyn Candies
reported  million in sales in  *end* If they play any role in all of this or not I cannot say *end* I certainly
do not suggest that any of my readers boycott their candies *end* That would be rather rash and certainly is
not what I want to see happen *end* Besides because they wholesale to others I don’t what other labels the
candy gets sold under *end*




A STRING OF STRANGE COINCIDENCES

A strange thing that happened to me that may be just coincidence or another piece of the puzzle *end* I will
not mention any names because I do not know how this all fits together *end* One of the men who owns
two Van Duyn stores is an ex-Missionary to Taiwan and a minister *end* This ex-Missionary still is on best
of terms close friend with the most powerful Free Chinese Army generals *end* He drives Cadillacs and
when he visits China is given the red carpet by his military general friend *end* This ex-
missionary/minister was a friend of mine and in  when he heard I had written a book he was
excited to buy my book because we were friends *end* When he found out the title was The Watchower &
The Masons he immediately lost interest in the book and never bought it *end* I asked him if he knew
anything about the Freemasons and he said he knew absolutely nothing about them *end* I thought that was
a strange reply because he was a leader of the Kiwannis in this area and I have been to his Kiwannis
breakfasts which were held in the basement of a Masonic Lodge here in Portland *end* How did this
minister arrange for his Kiwannis club to meet in a Masonic Lodge yet know nothing about the
Masons *end* Further there are many Masons with his surname so that at least within his extended family
I would expect some of them are Masons *end* Later this man’s son-in-law also a minister called me to
this son-in-law’s office in a particular church and told me I should be excommunicated by Christians
for trying to expose Billy Graham even though this ministers church doesn’t excommunicate *end* He
gave me mean looks and further told me "You will die for your sins *end* I dont know if this owner of
Van Duyn stores has any relationship to the larger picture or if all this is Just a number of strange
coincidences *end*
I don’t even know if the Van Duyn candy company is related in anyway to the Van Duyn family
although one informant claims it is *end*


A VAN DUYN & THE CIA MI MOSSAD NSA ETC *end*
MI was intimately involved in the creation of the CIA and MOSSAD *end* And MI is the guiding hand
behind those two organizations *end* British Intelligence was integrated under the title British Security
Coordination which was the world’s largest and most powerful intelligence beast in the world *end* This
beast has been under total control by the Illuminati since its beginning *end* Since  when the BSC was
set up in New York the Americans have worked for the British *end* But the intelligence community in the
UK USA Canada Australia NZ has gone a step beyond the secret intrigue of intelligence agencies
secretly controlling other intelligence agencies *end* They have actually signed formal agreements which
completely make all these acronym monsters into one intelligence agency *end* There is The Technical
Cooperation Program TTCP and the ABCA Agreement which concerns intelligence information
exchange in the areas of defense research and development *end* The ABCA Agreement concerns military
intelligence *end* The BRUSA Agreement on May   established exchange of personnel and the
most intimate cooperation at the highest levels by the various national intelligence agencies of all
high-grade COMINT *end* A Secret Treaty of  linked all the major commonwealth and American
intelligence groups *end* This is just one of countless agreements most secret for the exchange of
information *end* At that point in time levels of secrecy were ULTRA very secret Pearl moderately
secret and Thumb secret *end* Pearl and Thumb later became Pinup *end* On  February  a National
Security Council Intelligence Directive NSCID- directed the NSA to be the principal US SIGINT
agency with the FBI and CIA basically working for the NSA *end* Although some people are claiming
that their is friction between the NSA and its front organizations the FBI & CIA it is hard to picture
that this friction is anything serious because many people in these front organizations work for the
NSA *end* The CIA MI and the Mossad all worked through the BCCI which was scandalized recently
although the elite kept the lid on the scandal *end* Together the UKUSA intelligence community or what
is better termed the NWO’s intelligence world-wide intelligence agency of which MI MI CIA
NSA FBI NZSIS RCMP SIS ASIO GCHQ NRO DIA & the SASB are simply departments have
together at least  people employed full time *end* If there was in the  time period a Van Duyn



serving as the liaison between these various intelligence "departments’ he would be a very powerful
man *end* There is a way open to me to confirm this about a Van Duyn if I get the time *end*


TWO OTHER PROMINENT EARLY DUTCH AMER *end* FAMILIES

One of the men who has worked for the NWO in their think tanks and with their intelligence agencies
is Professor William R *end* Van Cleave who is a descendent of the New Netherlands families *end* His name
is mentioned now because it is quite possible the Van Cleave’s and the Van Duyn’s intermarried *end* I
know that William Van

Duyn married Sarah Van Cleef in Somerset NJ in around  *end* Prof *end* Van Cleave worked for RAND
Stanford Research Institute Dept *end* of Strategic and Defense Studies at the Univ *end* of So *end* Calif *end* and was
an advisor to the Pentagon the SALT conferences etc *end* The Van Cleves are said to have originated
from an ancestor Jan Van Cleef who was the son of Dutch nobility--the last Duke of Cleves *end* He is
said to have come to America in  *end* Two of the Van Cleaves were Scottish Rite Masons in
Chicago around the turn of the century *end*


SOME IMPORTANT CONNECTIONS -- COLLINS - WHITNEYS - VANDERBILTS

William Collins Whitney a member of the Illuminati via the Skull & Bones Order is someone who I
suspect was part of the Collins family *end* The Collins family is without doubt one of the top
Illuminati families *end* William Collins Whitney was a directory of Guaranty Trust as well as his son
H.P *end* Whitney who served later *end* William Collins Whitney married Flora Payne daughter of Standard
Oil’s Treasurer Oliver Payne *end* William Collins Whitney’s two sons were both members in the Skull &
Bones and one of them married Gertrude Vanderbilt another originally early Dutch American
family *end* The money that the Whitney family had amassed from the Payne’s and the Vanderbilts then
was put into Guaranty Trust J.P *end* Morgan and Guggenheim *end* Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt was a
member of the Skull & Bones Order init *end*  *end* A *end* Vanderbilt was sent a warning not to sail on the
Lusitannia because the elite knew it was to be sunk but he failed to get the telegram and sailed to his
death *end* Whitman Vanderbilt was part of the group of Illuminati that made up the Round Table in
which the Satanic Astors and Satanic Cecils played a big role *end* I have sometimes wondered if rather
than the Van Duyn’s that the name we should be dealing with is Vanderbilt *end* In any case the point is
that several of these originally Dutch families are in deep with the Illuminati *end* The origin of the
Vanderbilt fortune is an obscure mystery *end* It was close to  billion in  and must exceed numerous
billions today *end* One reference states that Cornelius Vanderbilt the original Vanderbilt who made it
rich made his large sums from blackmail Minnigerode Meade *end* Certain Rich Men *end* New York G.P *end* Putnam’s Son  pp - *end* Lindsay Russell of the Russell family--another top  Illuminati
family worked for the Vanderbilts *end* It was Lindsay Russell who started the Pilgrim Society--which is
the ° of the branch Illuminati *end* Lindsay Russell was also chairman of the CFR which is the ° *end*
The Vanderbilts the Whitneys the Goulds and the Rockefellers gave large sums of money to Billy
Graham for his New York Crusade *end*


THE DUTCH CONNECTION TODAY

Many ex-Nazis and elite industrialists have made their homes in the Garderen-Putten area of the
Netherlands *end* The Bilderbergers are building a superhotel/conference center near this area *end* One of the
companies involved in building the hotel is the Nazi family of Nachanius *end* The Belgium-Dutch
connection to the Illuminati is not trivial *end* The Dutch William of Orange deposed English King James
II in the fighting of - *end* That is significant because it appears that Illuminati financial
headquarters were in Amsterdam prior to William of Orange’s victory *end* After that victory they moved



to London *end* One only has to note how important Brussels has been to the New World Order to realize
that the lowlands of Belgium and the Netherlands continue to be important for the elite *end* For instance
the Beast--the supercomputer which is notified within seconds of every financial transaction you
carry on at an ATM is located in Brussels *end* If the Van Duyn family were indeed one of the top
families it might break open some big clues to understanding thc Belgium connections and elements
within the Illuminati *end* Earlier newsletters and the Be Wise As Serpents book have described high level
rituals carried out in a castle burg in Belgium *end* There are dutchmen in the genealogy of the
Roosevelt presidents in the line that goes back to the British royalty *end* Other prominent elitists tie back
to the Netherlands & Belgium also *end* Elizabeth Van Buren wrote The Sign of the Dove which is a book
about the Merovingians the  Top Illuminati bloodline and Jesus *end* The book takes a gnostic
approach to religion and puts forth the idea that the Merovingians were of extra-terrestrial descent *end* I
had expected to find the town of Duyn from which the Van Duyn would have taken their name but
none of the maps so far have shown it *end* I had expected to find more important Van Duyns in the
Netherlands and in the U.S *end* Instead I only found a Hidde Hendrick Van Duym who came over from
the Netherlands and became a state educational official *end* Clearly I have only broken the surface in
trying to understand the Dutch connection in the Illuminati *end*


CONCLUSIONS & SUMMARY

It has been theorized by others that at the top of the Illuminati are unknown superiors so this should
not scare anyone that I don’t have all the details and that the family is unknown *end* On the other hand it
is very hard to hide people who wield immense power *end* So far I have dealt with families that were
definitely within the top  Illuminati families *end* If the Van Duyn family is part of the top  it may
represent the ‘Dutch-Flemish-Belgium segment of the Illuminati just as the Astors & Rothschilds
came from Germany the DuPonts from France the Li’s from China and the Kennedy’s from Ireland *end* Actually the entire  top families are related in various ways and their heritages go back to the
ancient nobility of Europe to the tribe of Dan and to the Khazars *end* Many of these top families feel
they are descendents of the House of David *end* One researcher has even told me that the royal house of
Japan is blood relation to the thirteenth top Illuminati family *end* Truth is often stranger than fiction but
this sounds truly incredible *end* That would be interesting if the genealogy which he claims does exist
does actually show that *end* It would help explain why Japan is being brought into the picture *end* I was able
only to identify that the Van Duyn family was a very early colonial American family of status and
that the few modern members of this family which I could identify are suspiciously tied to the
establishment and fit the type of persons we would expect from a top  family *end* If anyone has any
information concerning this subject that information would be appreciated *end*


REVISITING THE VAN DUYN FAMILY - ONE OF THE TOP  ILLUMINATI FAMILIES

The Dutch-Belgium connection is one link that is very powerful in the Illuminati but an area of
which my knowledge is very scattered *end* I am trying to rectify that ignorance *end* Since my big article in
the July   issue about the Van Duyns I received more confirmations and tips from ex-
Illuminati informants *end* So I have continued my search for details on the Van Duyn family *end* I was given
the tip that the Illuminati members of this family were located in someplace ike Michigan and I did
indeed find that the Grand Rapids area has a large number of Van Duyns *end* There are also a small
smattering of Van Duyns there are a few variant spellings such as Van Duine at Lansing MI; North
Oakland MI; Minneapolis MINN; and St *end* Paul *end* I was also able to identify one more Van Duyn who
has been part of the power structure and might possibly then be part of the actual secret generational
Satanic cult activity *end* This man was an official for UNESCO *end* I have had ex-Witchcraft sources tell me
that UNESCO was passing NWO instructions on to them *end* UNESCO is one of the more directly
controlled and more dangerous U.N *end* organizations *end* My writings have referred to it before *end* This man’s
name is Robert Gerald Vanduyn *end* He married florence Elizabeth Noyer *end* Robert Vanduyn served as the
associate director of the W.K *end* Kellogg Foundation which is a large foundation with HO in Battle



Creek Michigan *end* The Kellogg Foundation gives grants to Catholic Universities to research along the
lines of Illuminati goals and a variety of other causes *end* For instance a   grant was given
to the American Association of Community and Junior Colleges *end* The purpose *end* ‘To implement a
national recruitment effort to enlist the support of government and corporate leaders to improve
policies concerning adult education and training." Of course as you know most national government
and corporate leaders are part of their power structure so of course they the Illuminati would like
these people in the decision making process of our junior colleges *end* The Foundation contributed
almost  in  to the Battle Creek Board of Education *end* That should give the foundation quite
a bit of clout in the local school board’s decisions *end* Many of the grants of the Kellogg Foundation are
to promote things in health care and agriculture which are in the general trend of what the Illuminati
is pushing for *end* The American government loaned Robert Vanduyn to UNESCO from  onwards *end* He was given the position of Coordinator of UNESCO Service World Bank Education project *end* To be
in that position shows he was part of the elite whether he was or wasn’t a Satanist *end* UNESCO is being
used to push a NWO education agenda on the world *end* Recently the death of Patricia Van Cleve Lake
opened up some more clues about the Van Duyns *end* In the July  article I mention on page  that one
of the other early Dutch families in New Amsterdam which intermarried with the Van Duyns was the
Van Cleves *end* Ten hours before Patricia Van Cleve Lake died on Oct *end*  she called her son and told him
the truth about who she was *end* The  paragraph death notice was buried on page  in an LA *end* paper I
think the LA Times *end* What she told her son on her death bed was that she was the daughter of
William Randolph Hearst and movie star Marion Davies *end* Various people noticed her resemblance to
Hearst but dared not speak about it publicly *end* Her son told people after she died ‘She lived her life on
a satin pillow *end* They took away her name but they gave her everything else." Patricia was always
introduced as "the niece" of Marion Davies who in reality was her mother *end* The rumor mill since the
s had claimed Patricia was Hearst daughter but it wasn’t until just this last month that it had
been publicly said *end*
The news links the Van Cleve family to Hearst *end* All this news is very interesting in light of several
previously establish facts *end* First Hearst who funded Billy Graham’s first  years of Crusades was part
of the Illuminati *end* Second the Illuminati often adopt out their children to hide their paternity and
ancestry *end* Third the Van Cleve family is linked to the Van Duyns which raises the possibility of links
between Hearst and the Van Duyns *end*
FOLLOWUP ARTICLE ON THE VAN DUYNS

The long Van Duyn article of the July  ‘ newsletter indicated that I was puzzled that I hadn’t
found more clues about the power of the Van Duyn family which an informant had told me was one
of the top  Illumanati families *end* Since that time I have spent time with a very knowledgeable ex-
Illuminatus and it was confirmed that the initial information was indeed correct the Van Duyns are
one of the top  Bloodlines *end* Some of the Satanic members of this bloodline are in the North Central
area of United States such as in Michigan *end* I found out that this bloodline keeps much of their money
in Europe and that they are linked to some ltalians -- the Mafia? *end*
With some more clues to pursue I hope to discover some more about this top Illuminati family which
has gone to such great lengths to be hidden *end* It is clear that they have kept their money and businesses
well hidden via holding companies and other gimmicks *end*


EPILOGUE

This collection of articles has tried to take the reader back stage to meet the families that control the
Illuminati and the world *end* One of the best places to see representatives of the different  families
together are when they gather for the Feast of the Beast *end* The back stage story is tar from being told *end* The Van Duyn family is a fitting way to end this book because the mystery that surrounds them
highlights the work that still remains to tell the complete story *end* The Van Duyn articles do not mention
Roel Van Duyn of Amsterdam Netherlands who founded/headed in modern times the



socialist/communist movement in the Netherlands *end* He was a powerful man *end* The movement was lead
by Provos provocateurs whose demonstrations at times got violent *end* What is the nature of the
relationship between the Van Duyn family and the Van Cleve family *end* I know there was some
intermarriage but due to time restraints I never completed my investigation down this avenue *end* While
Roel Van Duyn was leading his radical movement Miss Davies father was livIng at Heart’s Riverside
Dr *end* No *end*  and her brother-in-law George Van Cleve was an executive in Hearst’s film corporation *end* The mystery of the Van Duyn family is also reflected in the mystery surrounding the Romanov
family *end* The Romanov family had more than the Russian branch there was for instance a Prussian
branch *end* And some of their family like the Grand Prince Alexis Romanov came to America where his

granddaughter Mary Teissier the cousin to Alexander Romanov was one of J *end* Paul Getty’s main
lovers *end* J *end* Paul Getty if you have forgotten was at one time listed by Fortune Magazine as America’s
richest man *end* Not only does Romanov blood flow in some of the Illuminati the Romanov name pops
up among the friends of Frank Sinatra *end* Mike and Gloria Romanov were friends of Frank Sinatra *end* Frank Sinatra’s social activities were like a Who’s Who in the Mafia and Illuminati *end* Frank Sinatra
would travel to France to spend time with Baron Guy de Rothschild or could be found doing a
charity ball for the World Mercy Fund with Laurance Rockefeller *end*
Mentioning the Rockefellers brings us right back to the Romanovs *end* And then who was Anne Marie
Rasmussen who married Nelson Rockefeller’s son Steven Clark Rockefeller *end* When one reads her
book There Was Once A Time of Islands *end* Illusions *end* & Rockefellers NY Harcourt Brace Jovanovich
 one learns that she was from Norway a maid in the Rockefeller home learned TM and was
shocked by the Rockefeller’s abundant ‘primitive’ art of the Rockefellers *end* ‘Primitive’ simply was a
Rockefeller expression for all the nude art that they have all around *end* In her book she talks about ‘The
Playhouse’ at Kykuit about Margaretta Happy Rockefeller’s close friend Mrs *end* Vincent Astor about
Laurance Rockefeller’s St *end* John Island where he built the Caneel Bay Plantation and the
Rockefeller’s ranch at Jackson Hole WY *end* Talking about the Astors brings us back to Frank Sinatra
who bought Mary Astor’s large rambling property in the Toluca Lake area of the San Fernando
Valley *end* Frank bought the land without even seeing it *end* Frank is not the only one not seeing things *end* So
much of what is being told us by our media is outright distortions *end* John D *end* Rockefeller Sr *end* would get
together secretly with WIlliam H *end* Vanderbilt and Jay Gould to scheme against the public *end* They took
oaths to cooperate while the public thought they were antagonists *end* And what about the Rockefeller-
Rothschild feud *end* And why did John Archbold John D *end* Rockefeller’s right hand man go overseas
and secretly work out business arrangements with the Rothschilds in the s *end* One CIA agent
described the ‘Company’ as a worn out whorer who needs to come in off the street and get cleaned *end* The Illuminati have made the CIA and used it for their own ends and have let the CIA be the fall guy *end* When we start looking

closer at the CIA we see men like Archie Roosevelt of the Roosevelt family who was a leader in the
CIA *end* going to places such as Nigeria to visit the Emir of Kano with David Rockefeller *end* This
Rockefeller/Roosevelt visit to the Emir was close to going to Timbuktu *end* David Rockefeller took
along his own private professor of Egyptology when he went to the pyramids and to Egypt *end* Perhaps
his love for Egypt relates to David’s fixation and love for beetles *end* Another aside is that America’s
foremost Egyptologist Dr *end* Charles Breasted was underwritten by the Rockefellers *end* But then those few
who understand the one to one correspondence of the Book of the Dead’s rituals and modern Satanic
rituals might not be surprised *end* Nelson Rockefeller was part of the National Security Council which
sits even higher than the CIA in Intelligence affairs *end* Speaking of far off places what about Mis
Osman Ali Khan who was the principal Moslem ruler of India at one time *end* And what about the multi-
millionaire possible billionaire Aga Khan Ill *end* These men interacted socially with the Illuminati
families *end* And how far does the Rockefeller wealth go *end* We know that through the Chase Investment
Corporation they have such far off holdings as a steel mill in Turkey and a cotton textile mill in
Nigeria *end* Creole Petroleum of Venezuela is owned by Nelson *end* Chase Manhattan has a full-time envoy
to the U.N *end* and the Secretary Generals of the UN visit the Rockefellers at their estate at Pocantico *end* A
number of families threw their selves in with the Rockefellers and owe their family wealth to the fact
that they served the Rockefellers *end* These include John D *end* Archbold the Harknesses the Bedfords the



Chesebroughs the Cutlers the Flaglers the Folgers the Paynes the Pierces and the Rogerses *end* The
Rockefeller’s have had a number of senators who he ‘owns’ *end* In  Senator Penrose received
 and Senator Bliss received  given via Rockefeller’s Standard Oil *end* One scholar wrote
against the Rockefeller control of politics ‘The Standard  Oil had done everything to the
Pennslyvannia legislature except refine it.’ Henry Demarest Lloyd Wealth Against the
Commonwealth *end* When the Rockefellers wanted to build a highway they would summon people like
Interior Secretary Stewart Udall to Nelson’s apartment where he talked Udall into permitting the
Rockefellers to build an unpopular highway *end* In  Hubert Humphrey wanted both David and
Nelson Rockefeller in his cabinet *end* The Rockefellers cooked up the idea to have a World Trade Center
in NY and their cronies were involved in the scandal to promote the idea *end* David wrote letters of
advice to Pres *end* J.F *end* Kennedy *end* Where do all these elite connections end *end* All these top  Illuminati
families tie together at the Feast of the Beast rituals *end* In addition to this grand meeting where Satan
puts in his personal appearance these families have smaller meetings and rituals frequently all over
the world *end* Their Council of  and their Council of  meet and send out their orders regularly *end* Volume  will examine how the Illuminati rule what their organizations are and what their life and
rituals are like *end* An Appendix so to speak *end* As I failed to provide a genealogical chart for the
Rockefeller Family while doing my newsletter articles I will as an appendix add that to this page *end* One of the families that intermarried with the Costellos was the Van Duyn family *end* But who are the
Costellos *end* Frank Costello died  was the underworld boss of New York for many years until
Vito Genovese died ‘ took control *end* Carlo Gambino took over from Vito until his death and then in
 Carlo in turn died and his heir Paul Castellano with some of the Gambino family took over *end* Now Roosevelt Rosy-or Rose Gambino runs the Gambino family The ;ambino family is related in
marriage to the Eli Lilly Illuminati family *end* Frank Costello had Jerry Catena working for him and
Eddie Torres was a close friend of Jerry Catena *end* Eddie Torres was the President of the Las Vegas
casino Riviera before Gus Greenbaum took over *end* Greenbaum was connected to all the Mafia and
was a casino manager for Meyer Lansky in Havana and other places *end* Lou Costello’s father was from
Italy *end* In Italy the name was spelled Cristillo *end* Lou Costello got Dean Martin into show business *end* Lou
provided Dean Martin the money for his nose job before Dean made it big in show business *end* Lou’s
daughter later married Dean’s son *end* Lou Perry and Costello both got Dean Martin into show business *end* Costello had great clout with MCA *end* Costello got disgusted with Dean Martin in  when Dean ran
up bills which he charged to Lou Costello *end* Later Dean ignored Lou at a Casino and also got Lou
Costello ticked off *end* Dean’s first wife was Betty McDonald *end* Betty’s father was Bill McDonald *end* See

Distributors who are the sole American distributors for Whiteley Co *end* of Scotland *end* Scotch drinkers like
the orange brown scotch of the famous King’s Ransom Scotch as well as the House of Lords Scotch *end* They may not realize that Costello was the sole distributor of these drinks which were imported
through him from Scotland *end* Ray Ryan a young Texas oil Tycoon went into at least one petroleum-

Sinatra Sammy Davis Jr *end* Peter Lawford and Joey Bishop were known as the Rat Pack *end* All of these
men were connected to the Mafia and some if them were satanists such as Sammy Davis Jr *end* and
Peter Lawford *end* In  these men posed together outside of the Sands casino for a picture where they
performed together *end* This picture of the Rat Pack is in the book Dino *end* Living High In the Dirty
Business of Dreams by Nick Tosches *end* Another picture of Dean Martin taken around  shows him
with Marilyn Monroe and Averell Harriman *end* Averell Harriman was in the Illuminati *end* Marilyn
Monroe was a Monarch sexual slave for the elite *end* Marilyn was a Presidential Model sexual slave for
JFK *end* JFK was part of the Kennedy Illuminati family and he often spent time with members of the Rat
Pack *end* The Hollywood Reporter described Dean Martin as a "hypnotically attractive homegrown



American monster." Frank Sinatra was a very cruel man too *end* Dean Martin Dino Crocetti grew up in
Steubenville which was known for its gambling and prostitution *end* A white-slavery ring that kidnapped
beautiful woman for whorehouses was headquartered in Steubenville *end* James Vincent Tripodi of the
Mafia ran Steubenville *end* A popular saying in Steubenville among the youth was ‘Learn to steal learn
to deal or go to the mill.’ Dino became a dealer at the Rex in Steubenville run by Cosmo Quattrone *end* Jerry Lewis a close associate to Dean Martin said "No one ever got to know him not even Betty his
wife." Herman Hover who lived at  North Bedford Drive in Beverly Hills bought his mansion
from the Vanderbilts *end* Howard Hughes did a lot of his business at the mansion *end* Mickey Cohen Gen *end* J *end* Wainwright Howard Hughs James Roosevelt FDR’s son and many other prominent people would
go to Hover’s Ciro nightclub *end* Later they would go over to Hover’s Mansion *end* The mansion was a
place of frequent parties that Dean Martin and others of his group would go to *end* In defiance of NBC’s
standards Dean Martin for his Dean Martin show was going to show off women trained as animals *end* Dean Martin would walk on the show with a voluptuous gal in a tiger outfit on a leash that Dean
would hold *end* The girl would then be telling Dean at every chance that she was not a girl but a fellow *end* When Dean married Kathy Hawn in  Frank Sinatra was his best man *end* Frank received a
diamond-studded golden cigarette lighter with an obscene inscription *end* Dean worked many years for
MGM Grand which now is built as a pyramid in Las Vegas with Monarch programming going on in
it *end* The theme inside the MGM is the Wizard of Oz which is for Monarch programming *end* To
understand the Wizard of Oz mind control programming the reader needs to get this author’s various
writings on the Monarch Programming which includes an Illustrated Guide To Monarch
Programming and other writings *end* Bob Hope an MI- agent who was used extensively in W.W *end* II to
trigger mind-controlled military men with the proper hypnotically embedded trigger words received
his own mind-controlled sex slaves after the war *end* One of these slaves of Bob Hope also worked for
the Illuminati’s Council of  *end* This author Fritz Spnngmeier knows her and she is one of the few
Illuminati slaves who has been deprogrammed *end* While she was a slave for Bob Hope he loaned her to
Sammy Davis Jr *end* Dean Martin and Richard Nixon to name a few *end* More about this Monarch slave
which was used as a courier and a sexual slave shortly *end* Let’s explain some about Bob Hope *end* Because
the previous paragraph may present the reader some difficulties let’s temporarily digress into the
entertainment field’s connections to the elite *end* The Caesars and the medieval kings recognized the
importance of controlling the people with entertainment *end* The occult world has long been connected
with entertainment *end* during W.W *end* II the U.S *end* and U.K *end* used almost everyone in the entertainment
fields to help with the war effort *end* There have been numerous connections in this author’s research
about the llluminati/CIA mind control which connects back to the U.S.O *end* the American military
entertainers that travelled in USO units on tours *end* The story about how the USO was used to carry
messages to mind-controlled agents and military men would include many names including Quent
Reynolds Bruce Cabot Joe E *end* Brown Andy Devine Candy Jones Jessica Wilcox and some many
lesser knowns such as Wheeler who later became known as the programmer Dr *end* Black *end* The military
apparently was already using programmed killers to carry out deadly assignments *end* Bob Hope & the
USO was used to carry trigger words to these mind-controlled people *end* For many years the world’s
experts in running spies--the British empire under the control of the Illuminati.-have been using
certain professions for spying *end* For instance Postmaster Generals are used for spying because they can
control the secret spying on mail *end* An example of this Benjamin Franklin postmaster general for the
colonies was an important spy for the Illuminati’s British Trading Companies/British government in
the colonies *end* To understand his role in the Illumminati contrived American Revolution read chap *end* . *end* in my Be Wise As Serpents *end* Likewise what better person to pick than Bob Hope to run
messages worldwide *end* Bob Hope was british and MI knew they could trust him *end* Bob Hope has an
excellent ability to learn and say lines *end* Bob was and still is great with words knowing how to fit them
together and to make puns and double and triple meaning sentences *end* His ability to construct sentences
with double meanings was a great cover for the hidden messages he transmited for allied intelligence
during the war *end* If you want to keep a secret the best place is out in the open *end* The British and
American intelligence agencies know this *end* Some of their greatest secrets are out in the open where no
one suspects what they are *end* Bob Hope *end* who was already a radio and movie star before W.W.II was
given wide publicity as he travelled all over for the U.S.O *end* the entertainment groups for the military *end* Bob Hope was ‘just an entertainer’ and yet he visited Roosevelt *end* Churchill Eisenhower Pattan and
all kinds of military men *end* Bob travelled all over the world to every front during the war including



England Africa the South Pacific *end* the East & west coasts of the U.S *end* the Caribbean Panama etc *end* He
could fit all kinds of signals into his jokes and talks and no one would be the wiser *end* Under the
disguise of building moral by being a comedian Bob could go anywhere and because he always was
making jokes no one took him seriously *end* Bob Hope was a courier a message bearer of coded
messages *end* Sometimes the coded messages almost seem to jump out when you look at his wartime
talks M and MIS’s Section BIA under the supervision of London’s W Board and  Committee
oversaw the running of double agents and mind-controlled couriers and mind-controlled spies *end* Special Intelligence Service SIS for the British dealt a great deal with mind-control of all types *end* Tavistock Institute of Human Relations was part of SIS’s mind control capabilities *end* Men like
Tavistock’s hypnotist/mind control expert Eric Trist were willing to perform mind-control on British
civilians/military men *end* Over the last  years perhaps the most popular place for couriers to be
signalled to meet was by someone holding a bird in a cage or at a shop with birdcages *end* The allusion to
carrier pigeons is so obvious *end* Look at a caption ‘Speaking of WRENS’ with a cartoon from Bob
Hope’s book I Never Left Home NY Simon & Schuster  written in  during the middle of
W.W.II *end* The cartoon shows Bob chasing a girl with a bird cage and saying ‘Tweet Tweet Tweet.’
Hypnotic commands are given  times *end* What seems like a harmless cartoon looks more like a signal
telling people that Bob Hope is in charge of a flock of carrier pigeons couriers *end* When talking to a
group of soldiers during the war Bob said "in London the bobbies caught a guy walking around in the
fog with a bird cage giving the mating call but the American consul got me.’

There is a great deal more that could be written perhaps books but Americans need to understand
that MI British intelligence started trained and still control American intelligence *end* Remember that
Canada entered W.W.II along with Britain and the British set up one of their best secret agent
training schools between Whitly and Oshawa Ontario in a place called Intrepid Park *end* The agents
called it "the camp" or "the farm." Now the CIA has their own "camp" or "farm’ which is Camp
Peary where they carry out mind-control *end* The British named this British Security Coordination
Special Training School No *end*  & Hydra *end* STS  *end* Some people called it Camp X *end* When the war
broke out the Amer *end* FBI OSS SOE SIS BSC and the Canadian RCMP all sent people to be
"trained" at the secret Camp X hidden on Lake Ontario’s north shore across from the US-CAN
border *end* British SOE Special Operations Executive set itself up for business in New York City and
during WW II directed operations from there *end* Let’s get back to explaining about Frank Sinatra a man
who spent time visiting with the Rockefellers the european and american Rothschilds and other
powerful figures including Bob Hope *end* Frank Sinatra who is well known world wide for his cruelty
would serve as the handler for Bob Hope’s Mind-controlled slaves when she sexually serviced men
in the Rat Pack *end* In other words Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin knew the cues the trigger code words
to get this slave to sexually serve them especially Frank *end* Because Dean knew about the Monarch
programming that is why he had the audacity to want to bring a slave on his show on a lease in a
tiger outfit *end* During the obedience training of a sexual slave they have an expensive collar put on them
and their mind-control programming for all sexual alters from infancy up is that they are cats *end* These
slaves have cat alters personalities who are spin-kitten alters *end* When Dean Martin as an older man
would sexually get younger women like Andre Boyer a  year old student at UCLA there is a good
chance that Andre and others like her were under mind-control *end*
Frank Sinatra’s parents were Natalie Dolly Della Garavante from Genoa and Anthony Martin
Sinatra from Catania Sicily *end* His mother was a cigar-smoking cruel foul mouthed woman *end* Dolly was
a midwife and abortionist before it was legal *end* Dolly didn’t always escape legal detection for her
illegal abortions *end* Just one of the times she was hauled into court was on Feb *end*  ‘ in a Hudson
Special Sessions Court *end* Frank’s parents always had money and so Frank grew up as a child who
always had money *end* He would share it with other kids if they would be his friend *end* Frank was known
as a lazy and mean boy as he grew up *end* He still did not have a steady job by the age of  and was still
living off his parents *end* Frank’s mother then decided to get him into singing *end* Due to his mother Frank
got some singing jobs and started going somewhere in life *end* After struggling for years Tommy Dorsey
got Frank Sinatra on the road to success with his band *end* Tommy Dorsey and Frank’s mother got along
great *end* Frank Sinatra wanted to emulate Benjamin "Bugsy" Siegel who was boss of Niurder Inc *end* Let’s
digress for a minute and explain that the Illuminati will use the Mafia for murders which don’t have



formal approval of the Illuminati hierarchy to carry out *end* About % of the dirty work for the
Illuminati is carried out by the Mafia *end* The Illuminati have their own death squads which are superior
to the Mafia but individuals must approach one of the Councils for approval to assassinate *end* Often its
easier for those in the Illuminati just to put an unauthorized contract out on someone *end* The Mafia are
often willing to make a business deal *end* The Mafia are intertwined with the occult and some of the
Mafia are involved in rituals mind-control programming etc *end* However there are a number of Mafia
who are only in it for the business end like many in the Yakusa *end* They are appalled at the heartless
things that the Illuminati are doing such as turning a whole generation of young people into drug
addicts etc *end* Some of the Mafia have much higher codes of honor than the Generational Satanists *end* Frank Sinatra’s hero Bugsy was associated with all the Mafia heads such as Charlie ‘Lucky’ Luciano
who controlled Marilyn Monroe as a slave and Frank Costello *end* The New Jersey Underworld kingpin
Willie Moretti aka Willie Moore was Frank Sinatra’s neighbor in Hasbrouch Heights *end* Bugsy was a
cruel man *end* Frank was in total awe of Bugsy almost enthralled to the point of worship *end* The Illuminati
turned to Bugsy and then later to the Gambino family when the needed someone killed *end* Later Bugsy
got on the bad side of other Mafia chiefs and was killed by them *end*
Frank Sinatra had a quick way of alienating people with his controlling anger *end* Frank alienated
William Randolph Hearst Jr *end* at a party by fighting with him *end* The Hearst papers started giving Frank
bad publicity after the fight *end* Frank’s agent and friend George Evans flew to Hollywood and through
Marion Davies who was William Randolph Hearst’s mistress for many years he was able to get in to
see the old man William Randolph Hearst Sr *end* who was ill *end* Frank was properly contrite and got the
old man to like him *end* Apparently with Marion Davis and the old man Hearst on his side Frank was
able to overcome the son’s orders to the Hearst papers to give Frank negative publicity *end* After his visit
with Marion and Hearst Sr *end* Frank began to get positive publicity again *end* For those who need to be
reminded the Hearst family is an

Illuminati family and the Hearst castle in Calif *end* which is owned by the State of California as a Park
continues to be used for rituals for the Illuminati hierarchy *end* Of special note is that Marion Davis was
connected to the Van Cleve family which is another family which has intermarried with the Van
Duyn family along with the Costellos *end* In case the reader missed it in a previous article a prominent
member of the Van Duyn family who headed California’s Teen Challenge helped get Billy Graham’s
ministry started *end* This person is a member of the Illuminati as well as being a Christian minister *end* I am
intentionally not mentioning his name *end* William Randolph Hearst paid for the first  years of Billy
Graham’s ministry *end* There are a number people of the Van Duyn bloodline in the Illuminati who are
also Christian ministers *end* I can’t give my sources-needless to say they are several people who have
been escaping the Illuminati *end* In the final analysis we can say that several Illuminati members of the
Van Duyn bloodline helped in the establishment of Billy Graham having a big crusade ministry *end* Frank Sinatra rubbed shoulders with many of the Illuminati *end* That doesn’t mean that he was a
member it is possible that his mafia ties are why he was so well received by Illuminati kingpins *end* The
Illuminati has a history of sharing their mind-controlled slaves with the Mafia even slaves who are
members within the Illuminati are shared *end* However the Illuminati always insures that they have final
control over a slave’s programming *end* One of the people who was a drummer with the Tommy Dorsey
Band for a while was William Joseph Bryan Jr *end* aka William Joseph Bryon and William Jenning
Bryan III etc *end* William Joseph Bryan Jr *end* was a CIA Mind-control programmer *end* He programmed
people when he was with the Air Force as Chief of Medical Survival Training which was a covert
brainwashing section If the Air Force *end* Bryan opened up his own hypnotherapy Institute on Sunset
Strip in Hollywood where he programmed some people in acting for the Illuminati *end* Bryan was the
person who programmed Sirhan Sirhan to kill Robert Kennedy *end* He also hypnotised Alvert Di Salvo *end* After Bryan died in spring  the CIA cleaned out all of his files including his home files *end* Bryan
was a ’  /" fat Satanic priest in the Old Roman Catholic Church *end* The CIA and the Illuminati have
connections in this offshoot of Catholicism *end* Bryan was a descendant of William Jennings Bryan the
Mason who supposedly defended the creation view in the Scopes Monkey Evolution Trial *end* WJ *end* Bryan III or Jr *end* was a frequent guest in many fundamentalist churches in Southern California *end* Its
interesting how the Tommey Dorsey Band had both Bryan and Sinatra in it since both men would go
on to be involved with Satanic mind-control in the future *end* William J *end* Bryan spoke to many judges so



it is possible he used his law degree to get him appointments with dirty judges that needed training
about the Illuminati’s Mind Control program *end* In William J *end* Bryan Jr.’s book entitled The Chosen
One The Art of Jury Selection Bryan teaches how to use hypnosis on jury members to win one’s
case *end* On the back of the book the author is described "in addition Dr *end* Bryan served as an Electronics
Engineer in the Navy in World War II was Director of all Medical Survival Training for the United
States Air Force and a leading expert on brainwashing." William J *end* Bryan was the technical director
for Frank Sinatra’s movie Manchurian Candidate which is a film which was used to scare
American’s into thinking the enemy was carrying out mind-control *end* This was so that if the Illuminati-
CIA horrible trauma-based mind-control was ever discovered that the CIA would be justified in the
minds of Americans for the horrible things they were doing *end* Illuminati Mind-controlled slaves were
forced to watch the movie Manchurian Candidate to further enhance their feelings of helplessness *end* Frank Sinatra made the movie by getting the rights from the book’s author for the story *end* The author
had as far as I know only stumbled upon what the Illuminati and their intelligence agencies were
doing *end* Frank Sinatra squelched the second release of the Manchurian Candidate film so it is clear that
the entire movie was an affair carried out by the CIA to squelch the true story and to intimidate those
thousands of Mind-controlled slaves that they’d created *end* This article has elaborated on the Costello
family and the Van Cleve family which are branches of the Van Duyns *end* Interestingly the elite
Bohemian Grove which has been used as a site for Satanic rituals for over  years has Joseph V *end* Costello Jr *end* and Peter Van Cleave as members *end* Peter Van Cleave stayed in the bungalow called Oz
when he was at the Bohemian Grove *end* Several Illuminati survivors have indicated that the Van Duyns
have power in California *end* If the Van Duyns family power is via the Costellos and Van Cleves and
other unmentioned offshoots of the family then finally the secrecy protecting the powerful Van Duyn
Satanic bloodline may be cracking for the first time *end* The Van Duyn family have changed the spelling
on their name *end* One group spells it Van Dine *end* Vance Van Dine is an important NWO figure who
graduated from Yale *end* He is an Episcopalian and has worked with the big international bankers *end* He
was born in San Francisco but lived in New York City area *end* He has been on the board of dir of the
german connected Vereinsbank Capital Corp *end* Another Van Dine of note is Harold Foster Van Dine
Jr *end* who has been a famous architect *end* He has been a major figure in the Troy MI company of Straub
Van Dine & Assoc *end*


Bloodlines of Illuminati

By

Fritz Springmeier

The Merovingian Bloodline



This page has been prepared to provide some type of table of contents to the various items which
‘will be included in this chapter "The Thirteenth Satanic Bloodline" *end* In my writings this bloodline has
been interwoveni into the text of many articles but It hasn’t been singled out very much *end* Although a
great deal has been mitten by this author on this final family to pull out articles which concentrate on
it solely is difficult *end* After assembling some pages on it a few words of explanation were still needed *end* Allow me to briefly explain those items which were selected

· An article on the top family that appeared in Feb *end* ‘ newsletter on page  *end*
· An appendix to the Be Wise As Serpents book about the British Royalty *end* The British Royalty are
tied in with the  Bloodline *end*
· Many of the American political leaders have been related to the British Royalty incl *end* George Bush
and Dan Quayle *end* A flier from a Christian conference is Included showing who the speakers are *end*
· Finally a little of the genealogical information I assembled on the Mormon leaden is given *end* This
was included in the Be Wise As Serpents book to give people an idea of how the Mormon leadenhip
ties back in with the leading occult bloodlines of the Merovingian dynasty *end* The chart for LDS
President Albert Smith is only about / typed out *end* The remainder of Albert Smith’s as well as other
Mormon leaden genealogical work is in a file in some unknown box at my house *end*
This bloodline is harder to track because it weaves in and out of the other  bloodlines *end* There are
many surnames which are part of this bloodline Including the Smith family however I can give one
very prominent one the Sinclair family *end* We know that Satan is the father of all lies and Christ told
the religions leaden who went out to destroy him that they were from the seed of Satan *end*
nd Feature Article--THE TH ILLUMINATI BLOODLINE *end*
The  Illuminati Bloodline is where the Anti-Christ will come from *end* This bloodline believes that it
has both the Holy Blood of Jesus and the blood or seed of Satan in its bloodline *end* In my Be Wise As
Serpents book I make reference to this bloodline but I never really took the time to explain it
completely *end* In fact I don’t fully understand this bloodline myself *end* I encourage those who want to
learn more about this bloodline to study the following books



Holy Blood Holy Grail by Lincoln Leigh & Balgent

The Messianic Legacy



TheTemple & the Lodge

Crusaders of the Grail by J.R *end* Church

The Anti-Christ King--Juan Carlos by Dr *end* Charles R *end* Taylor

This bloodline is so extensive in its many branches that its membership takes in many of the
Presidents of the United States including George Hush and George Washington *end* The reason that I
gave the geneologies of the some of the Mormon Presidents to people back in  in my Be Wise As
Serpents book is that all of the Mormon Presidents in history whether RLDS or LDS trace their
blood back to this  bloodline *end* Within the Illuminati rituals the emphasis of the  bloodline is
that they are the seed of Satan *end* As their secret story goes they are the direct descendents of Jesus’s
spiritual brother Lucifer *end* Since the Freeman family and the Rothschild family have members who are
also in the  bloodlIne It is unclear to me how interwoven the "seed of Satan" is *end*
Some of the earilest attempts to trace the seed of Satan were some books which did extensive research
on the Tribe of Dan and the decendents of Cain *end*
"The Curse of Canaan" is an interesting book along with its mate World Order by Eustice Mullins *end* One of the books which I looked with difficulty for before finding it was Gerald Massey’s A Book of
the Beginning Secaucus NJ University Books Inc *end*  *end* The book goes in and shows in detail
how the inhabitants of the British Isles came originally from Egypt *end* This is Important because as this
newsletter has always contended the Druidism of the British Isles was simply a derivative from the
Egyptian Satanic witchcraft/magic of Ancient Egypt *end* The Egyptian word Makhaut clan or family
became the the Irish Maccu and the Maccu of the Donalds clan of Donalds now reflected in the
name MacDonald *end* The sacred keepers of the Clan-Stone in Arran were also known by the family
name of Clan-Chattons *end* Another word for clan is Mack and the Clan-Chattons were also known as
Mack-Intosh *end* Ptah-rekh the name of the Egyptian god Ptah was passed down to us by the Druids
adopting the name Patrick which sounded similar *end* St *end* Patricks day then is a Christianized form of a
druidic holiday which originally had its origins in Egypt *end* The All-Seeing Eye can be found on ancient
buildings in ancient Chaldea in ancient Greece and in ancient Egypt *end* The MI-seeing eye represents
Osirus *end* Osirus had debauched revelries saturualias celebrated in his honor *end* The temples in Arabia
clear back in the time that Moses had his black father-in-law Jethro used the all-seeing-eye to
represent the false satanic trinity of Osiris Isis and Horus of Egypt *end* This MI-Seeing Eye pops up
everywhere the Illuminati has been *end* In the Winter Palace Square in St *end* Petersburg Russia is that
Illuminati all-seeing eye on top of a pyramid *end* You will also see it in the old Mexican Senate Buildlng
which is now a museum in Mexico City *end* You will find this on the back of our one dollar bill and you
will find the all-seeing eye was placed on Ethopian stamps when they got a communist government in
power *end*
The Illuminati is the continuation of the Mystery Religions of Babylon and Egypt *end* And the bloodlines
of the Illuminati go back to people who at one time lived in Babylon and Egypt *end* Just how the House
of David the Satanic one and the Holy Blood of the  family fit in with everything else in history
I can’t say *end* I’m sure It would be a big story to tell If I knew *end* But I do feel that somehow the
Illuminati family does goes back to ancient times *end* Is this via the Tribe of Dan or via some Druidic
bloodline or is it via the Merovingians or is it via all three’ And where do the Guelphs and Black
Nobility fit Into this *end* Whatever the case the  bloodline has amassed a great deal of power and
wealth on this planet *end* The  bloodlIne lacks nothing to bring forth their Anti-Christ who will
appear to have all the correct credentials *end* I would not even be surprised if their Anti-Christ in order to
appear real will expose another Anti-Christ *end* The  bloodline has kept its geneologies very secret *end* I
would welcome more Input from informed persons about this bloodline *end* The tribe of Dan was
prophesied to be the black sheep of the nation of Israel which would bite the other tribes of Israel *end* The tribe of Dan had the snake and the eagle as its two logos *end* The tribe of Dan left its cailing card all
over Europe as it migrated west in the names of many places *end* The tribe of Dan ruled the Greeks the
Roman Empire the Austro-Hungarian empire and many others which used the eagle as its logo *end*


Great Britian is the mother country of Satanism *end* Scotland has long been an occult center *end* The
national symbol of Scotland is the dragon the snake and for years the chief of Scotland was called
the dragon *end* The Gaelic language is an important language for Satanism although English and French
are also use extensively by the Illuminati *end* The planning sessions for world takeover that some ex-
Satanists experienced were held in french *end* The British Royal Family have long been involved with
the occult *end* For more information on this there is a detailed examination of the Royal family and the
occult in the book The Prince and the Paranormal -the Psychic Bloodline of the Royal Family by
John Dale  *end* They have also been actively involved with Freemasonry *end* See the chart *end* British
MI has been a major vehicle for the Satanic hierarchy working behind the secret veil of Freemasonry
to control world events *end* British MI is the most secret intelligence organization in the world *end* It is
properly known as British Secret Service not to be confused with the U.S *end* agency by that name but
performing a different function entirely *end* The British Royalty have served as important figureheads to
British Freemasomy lending credibility and respectibility *end* British Freemasonry has managed to keep
itself free of much of the criticism that the other national masonic groups have brought on themselves *end* However much of the credibility of British Freemasonry is undeserved *end* True British Freemasonry is
what it portrays itself to the public for the lower levels *end* But *end* the lower level Masons by their dues and
activities are unwittingly supporting an organization that is led by Satanists at the top *end* An example of
the subterfuge constantly exercised on the public by Freemasonry is a book purportedly written by a
non-Mason entitled The Unlocked Secret Freemasonry Examined *end* The book portrays itself as an
unbiased and complete expose of Freemasonry *end* The book states unequivicably that the Masonic order
called Societas Rosicrucian in Anglia sic is only open to Christians and is a "Christian Order."
However Edith Star Miller reprints copies of a number of letters from the chief of the Societas
Rosicruciana in Anglia which show that the English Grand Masonic Lodge the SRIA the OTO and
the German illuminati are all working together *end* She briefly explains how she obtained the letters *end*

THE SKILL OF LYING

THE ART OF DECEIT

The Disney Bloodline

The Illuminati have refined the art of deception far beyond what the common man has imagined *end* The
very life & liberty of humanity requires the unmasking of their deceptions *end* That is what this book is
about *end* Honesty is a necessary ingredient for any society to function successfully *end* Deception has
become a national pastime starting with our business and political leaders and cascading down to the
grass roots *end* The deceptions of the Illuminati's mind-control may be hidden but in their wake they are
leaving tidal waves of distrust that are destroying America *end* While the CIA pretend to have our nations
best interest at heart anyone who has seriously studied the consequences of deception on a society
will tell you that deception will seriously damage any society until it collapses *end* Lies seriously damage
a community because trust and honesty are essential to communication and productivity *end* Trust in
some form is a foundation upon which humans build relationships *end* When trust is shattered human
institutions collapse *end* If a person distrusts the words of another person he will have difficulty also
trusting that the person will treat him fairly have his best interests at heart and refrain from harming
him *end* With such fears an atmosphere of death is created that will eventually work to destroy or wear
down the cooperation that people need *end* The millions of victims of total mind-control are stripped of
all trust and they quietly spread their fears and distrust on a subconscious level throughout society *end* One problem about lies is that one lie will call for another and then another *end* It's hard to keep lies
single *end* They seem to want to breed more of their kind to protect themselves *end* Soon the liar becomes a
victim of his own lies trapped in a dishonest web that demands lots of energy to protect his false
fronts *end* This is the sad fate that the intelligence agencies have painted themselves into *end* They must
maintain groups that oversee their double-agents' lies to insure that the lies that they have
disseminated don't contradict themselves *end* Finally they have put out so much disinformation they
lose track of reality themselves *end* Far from saving this nation the intelligence agencies have spread the
cancer of deception into all walks of life so that this cancer is contaminating and killing anything of
value in the United States *end* The soon-to-come death of this nation's sovereignty as well as the
destruction of this nation's morals are the results of this cancer *end* People who have attended high level
Illuminati meetings were instructed in how the Illuminati plan to bring in the NWO AntiChrist reign
by making everything appear as if it has happened naturally *end* The Illuminati have decided to
camouflage their actions with the creation of normalcy to avert any suspicions *end* An example of
something which appears to have happened naturally is the O.J *end* Simpson case which was planned
based on previous murder scenarios which had been successfully covered up *end* O.J *end* Simpson was a
CIA mind-controlled slave and the entire Simpson case was concocted as an elaborate effort to cause
racial tensions *end* The Mishpucka the CIA the Mob and the Illuminati have all had their dirty hands
involved in the entire affair *end* The entire affair reeks of manipulation and planning *end* It is not the goal of
this paragraph to go into the case but just to drop a couple details *end* Joey Ippolito Jr *end* is both CIA &
Mob *end* Ippolito at one time lived in Hallendale FL a mob housing subdivision which was protected by
a police force run by the mob *end* He has helped run drugs and wet ops for "the Combination" which
interconnects with the Illuminati *end* O.J *end* Simpson's friend Cowlings worked for Joey Ippolito as well as
O.J *end* Simpson *end* Simpson distributed cocaine for Joey Ippolito & the Combination *end* Simpson's lawyer
also is tied to the Illuminati the CIA and the mob *end* One of his lawyers on TV said the trial reeked of
government corruption *end* Nicole Simpson lived next door to Carl Colby former CIA director Bill
Colbys son *end* Colby's wife and kids have been subjected to mind-control *end* Colby's wife testified in O.J *end* Simpson's trial but was addressed as "Miss Boe" rather than by her name *end* O.J *end* Simpson's mother
worked for a California State Mental Hospital in San Francisco for  years *end* Many State Mental
Hospital workers have children who have been programmed *end* When one of the jurors in Simpson's



case Tracy Hampton had her mind-control programming go haywire she began staring for long
periods at a blank TV and hearing voices *end* She had to be dismissed *end* During the Simpson trial Judge
Ito gave Joe McGinniss the best front-row seat that a journalist could have *end* Joe McGinniss was the
coverup author who wrote a book covering up about the McDonald-Fort Bragg Drug Smuggling
Case *end*
The McDonald-Fort Bragg Drug Smuggling Case involved the Illuminati drug smuggling operation
within the U.S *end* military during the Vietnam War *end* On and on the stink goes *end* The manipulation of
history by those in power has been well-covered over *end* An example of how mind-control and its role
in manipulation of events has been covered up by the perpetrators is an article written in the Journal
of the American Medical Association JAMA in the Sept *end*   Vol *end*  No *end*  issue *end* The
article which was submitted to the magazine from three CIA doctors Mark Sweet and Ervin
claims that riots are caused by brain disease *end* While the article is correct in the subpoint that only a
small percentage of underprivileged urban dwellers participate in many of the riots the article's thesis
is obviously a slide to prevent people from catching on that the small number of deviants who create
riots might be under mind-control or might have some other motivation beyond simply being brain-
diseased *end* Any deception whether it is an exaggeration or an understatement of the NWO's
capabilities is considered a useful deception for the Illuminati's double-agents to spread *end* The german
battleship the Bismarck was sunk due to a little lie sent to Germany by a double-agent which
underestimated the range of British radar *end* The Germans thinking they were out of British radar
range made some bad decisions that cost them the battleship *end*
DECEPTION DIMINISHES POWER

Knowledge is power and lies diminish the knowledge of deceived dupes and therefore diminishes
the power of the deceived *end* Deception obscures the alternatives that people have *end* It also clouds up
various objectives people would work toward *end* Some people give up certain objectives due to their
mis-perceptions that the objective is undesirable or unattainable *end*


PROGRAMMING DECEPTIONS

In the programming colors and directions are used *end* Be prepared to find out *end* that sometime
programmers use their creative imaginations such as using the color "octarine" or the direction
"TURNWISE" or perhaps "WIDDERSHINS" *end* During the most fundament programming which is
done via LSD trips in sensory deprivation tank to lay in foundations of the Alpha Beta Delta Ome
and Theta programs each programming memory will be given a code *end* Where one popular
programming deception takes place that the programmer knows ahead of timeto sequence his
memory codes so that instance the fifth memory is coded as trip and strenuous methods are used to
up the memories of the first four trips *end* victim’smind will be told to forget the four trips *end* The
memory codes are deceptively designed to fool the deprogrammer and the victim alike *end* Part of the
reason the programmer does this is that they know that IF a therapist should stumble onto these first
memories the backup programming to protect these memories is so severe that the therapist will
shatter the victim’s mind *end* Backup programs such as Atom bombs and vegetable programming are
locked into place to protect the fundamental programs *end*


BE WISE AS SERPENTS

The Holy Spirit moved an apostle to write "We are not ignorant of Satan’s devices." Christ warned
his disciples to "be wise as serpents and harmless as doves." The Israelites sent out spies before
entering the promised land *end* Within the text of The Art of War by Sun-Tzu a book studied today by
men in intelligence he discusses "hidden provocation agents" in Book  *end* Sun-Tzu was born in
B.C *end* and lived most likely until after the year  B.C *end* In  B.C *end* some men were farmers and
some were agent provocateurs *end* Today both occupations still exist *end* The modern American farmer is



vastly superior to the ancient farmer of  B.C *end* so how does the modern agent provocateur
compare *end* He is vastly superior also *end* It appears the Word of God is accurate for it warns that God’s
people will be destroyed for lack of knowledge *end* The difficulty in obtaining honest information in
today’s Big Brother world is aptly described by an intelligence asset over the Internet "If you are
lucky and work hard you will find some of the truth *end* If you are lucky and work REALLY hard you
might find the WHOLE truth...as someone wants you to know it *end* If you are PHENOMENALLY
lucky and really work your tail off you might even go on to find the REAL truth *end* But no
outsiders...and in fact very few insiders ever .. *end* EVER .. *end* learn the WHOLE REAL truth."

This book & our two previous books on mind-control are the result of extremely hard work and
numerous miracles of God and what non-Christians would call lots of luck" *end* The story behind the
books is amazing *end* This book’s two authors have had to swim upstream" for years in search for the
real truth *end* One thing is very clear to this author during the last seven years of exposing the NWO
almost every person who is believed to be a leader against the NWO has tried to impede the work this
author has been doing *end* People need to be aware that the New World Order created their own
opposition long before some of us began sincerely trying to expose it *end* This author’s informed opinion
is that essentially all about % of the people leading the opposition to the NWO are double agents
and no less than % of the therapists are double-agents *end* In this state this author knows as a fact that
% of the licensed therapists working with programmed DID patients are programmed DID MPD
slaves themselves *end* Recently one of the therapists in this area who the False Memory "Spin"-drome
& the Illuminati took down was a therapist who had also been on a local T.V *end* talk show revealing
that she was a multiple & a SRA victim *end*


DISINFORMATION TO MAKE THEIR DOUBLE-AGENTS LOOK GOOD

"A Force" was MI-’s group that carried out deception *end* They would have their double agents pass out
CHICKEN FEED which is what they call classified information that can be thrown out to the public
to establish their double-agents’ credentials BONA FIDES as agents against the British *end* Today
there are numerous anti-NWO people who are actually double agents *end* They are distributing chicken
feed to make people think they are legitimate *end* By the way it is interesting to note for those who
realize how important carousels are to programming that MI- HO in Vauxhall Cross Eng *end* with a
training ctr *end* at Ft *end* Monckton near Gosport so *end* Eng *end* is nicknamed actually its cryptonym
Carousel" by its daughter organization Mossad officially aka Central Intelligence Collection
Agency *end*
An example of a double-agent who is popular among Christians is an Illuminati witch named
Gretchen Passantino who tours around to Christian conferences belittling the idea of mind-control *end* Dr *end* Loreda Fox reports in The Spiritual and Clinical Dimensions of MPD that % of women abused
by SRA come from "Christian homes." The Christian churches are heavily infiltrated *end*


SLEEPER AGENTS

In the Vol *end*  book a number of references were made to sleeper agents *end* The idea of placing someone
somewhere in society and letting them lead a normal life for years without ever being used is
designed to provide a legitimate smokescreen about what they are all about *end* Mind-controlled slaves
make excellent sleepers *end* The concept of making sleeper agents in not a secret *end* The CIA has publicly
admitted that they tried to discover long-range sleeper agents in the Los Niñios children of
Republican Spain who were the descendants of communist spaniards who returned to Spain in the
’s *end* They also have admitted to having tried to weed out long range sleepers in the Trebizond
Greeks who lived near the USSR in Turkey and returned in the ’s to Greece *end* As the CIA and
KGB mirror-imaged each other in their manufactured Hegelian Dialectic mock dual which was very
real for the "little" person you can well imagine that the CIA sent sleeper agents against the KGB *end*




NAMES of TYPES of DISINFORMATION AGENTS

The intelligence agencies have their own lingo for the types of disinformation agents they send
against everyone else *end* So far we have named only double & sleeper agents *end* Here are some of their
disinformation agents



AGENT OF INFLUENCE--These agents can be unwitting under mind-control or ideologically
motivated to use their positions of influence to sway the minds of others *end* Examples of Agents of
Influence are anchor men on T.V *end* journalists labor leaders TV commentators academics quoted by
the media & some politicians *end*
CONFUSION AGENT--An agent whose job is to produce confusion by disseminating confounding
information *end*
CONTRACT AGENT--These are the rogue agents such

as the mob who the CIA get to do particular jobs on contract *end* Their connections can be denied *end*
DEEP COVER AGENT--A sleeper agent often a programmed multiple or person with mind-control
programming who has been a long term sleeper agent *end*
DISINFORMATION AGENT--This is a highly placed agent who passes disinformation to other
governments *end*
NOTIONAL AGENT--A fictitious non-existent "agent" which is created with a real-looking identity
to mislead *end*
PROVOCATION AGENT--An agent sent in to provoke & destabilize the target group to do foolish
things *end*
SPOON-FEEDER AGENT--Someone who dribbles out legitimate information this is often done to
build up a person's credentials bona fides *end* Lots of the people who are pretending to expose the
NWO are spoon-feeder agents who provide a little new information tons of already known secrets
and sprinkle in a measure of disinformation for added fun *end* Generally spoon-feeders increase their
percentage of disinformation once they gain respectability *end* There are very few people really exposing
anything of consequence about the NWO *end* This author has endured the loss of several of the really
legitimate whistle blowers who were friends being assassinated since he began writing exposes *end*
What this means is that agents for groups that do mind-control may have been sleepers for many
years and look very legitimately innocent they may give good correct information to our side they
may say all the right things and try to get us motivated to do more than we would want they may talk
about other friends who are giving them information who do not even exist *end* It takes discernment to
spot people who are not on our side *end* Unfortunately such discernment seems to be fundamentally
lacking within the public at large *end* For instance I have seen people choose obvious NWO agents over
this author as a source of "information" which is in reality disinformation *end* Most people have bought
so much disinformation during their lifetime perhaps it’s unrealistic to expect them to purge out all
the junk they’ve accepted *end* Just as people in the world need to toss out their worldly thinking people
in the church need to toss out all the indoctrination they’ve gotten from the numerous kinds of harlot
churches *end* At the moment the system is set up so that the perpetrators of the mind-control are in
control of the credentialing process so that they can provide their stooges/and agents with the best
credentials *end* As the reader can see the roots of power behind the mind-control go deep *end*




TRICKING SUSPECTS

One trick or variations of it that has been used with suspects is to arrest them place the suspect in a
situation where the police are in two groups--one group looks like police the other group looks like
the group the suspect has come from *end* After the suspect arrives the group pretending to be arrested
group members overpowers the police contingent and escapes to another setting where another police
group pretending to be even more of the suspect’s group ask him who he is and to explain his
credentials *end* Letting his guard down the original suspect explains what he is all about thereby giving
them the information they needed in the first place *end* Variations of this script can be run *end* English
intelligence calls this basic script CACKLEBLADDER because chicken blood is used on the police
actors that are overpowered to make them look injured *end*


THE NAMES OF DECEPTION TRICKS

FOUR FACES refers to pretexts used by agents to get interviews *end* DANGLE is the craft word for
luring a victim into a provocation *end* A dangle operation would be an operation to provoke a group or
individual into a particular action *end* This was done with Elohim City and many other groups that the
NWO is trying to set up as patsies *end*


STANDARD DECEPTION DEVICES

Agents use BLEEP-BOXES to tap telephones and in other instances to make free-of-cost telephone
calls *end* A CABMAN is a device to remotely activate a telephone with a radio beam *end* It can be used
without entering the building where the telephone is located *end*


MASKS

The use of masks in the occult world is ancient *end* For centuries the gypsies have used them for their
hypnotic powers *end* Special healing masks for their people are kept secret and never shown to the
public *end* Masks have a shock value & fascination value *end* Gypsy and other occult groups have special
rituals to create the masks including using hair clippings from the person who will wear the mask *end* Gypsy healing masks are destroyed after the patient gets well *end* Illuminati programming masks may or
may not be destroyed after their use *end* The Illuminati’s mask-making abilities according to
deprogrammed victims of their mind-control are very high quality *end* Sometimes the programmers
simply wear halloween cartoon character masks that anyone can obtain to fulfill their role in the
programming script that they are involved in during the time *end*
COVERS

Some beginners who have just started into studying the World Order question why the Illuminati
would use legitimate religious covers *end* Why would the Illuminati want to create a slave who is an
evangelist *end* Why *end* Because those new converts will go to some establishment church where other
programmed multiples in leadership positions will demand obedience and then support those
demands by quoting scriptures that make them seem like they are God’ss authority over that new
convert *end* Because the evangelist or missionary and the bishop or pastor are controlled puppets the
convert will never get the full truth just enough truth to keep him working hard for their organization *end* Even though the convert "got God in my life" the Illuminati never lose control over him *end*
The Christians have as much vested interest in preventing the exposure of the Illuminati programmed
multiples who are big name Christian ministers running Christendom as the Illuminati has *end* Imagine
what would happen if the world found out that most of Christianity was run by the human-sacrificing
slave-making Illuminati *end* This is one of the sad effects of the infiltration *end* Perhaps the subject of



covers can be explained from another angle *end* The reader knows that the elite like monopolies *end* They
play monopoly for real--for us it’s oniy a board game *end* To establish a monopoly you find a good
product that everyone wants or needs and then you eliminate all the competition by either destroying
them or owning the competition yourself *end* In the U.S *end* the Illuminati can’t have a one-religion
monopoly *end* In Russia they had communism with Marx and Lenin as the Father God and Gon the son
figure *end* Communism had a monopoly on worship *end* In the U.S *end* they have established a monopoly by
controlling all the various religious groups *end* This author wrote an  page heavily documented book
Be Wise As Serpents to show the details of how this is done *end* It’s not a matter of what they teach it’s
a matter of control so that the elite have a monopoly *end* And when you as a mover & shaker in the
world control all these various religions via money blackmail & programmed multiples under your
leadership etc *end* which religion would you pick to emphasize the most *end* You will pick the one that sells
the best i.e *end* the best product *end* And which brand of Christianity will sell the best *end* The televised
charismatic brand will sell the best *end* Covers that slaves use to explain what they do in life are almost
always "legitimate" *end* A missionary a military officer a salesperson etc *end* will usually actually do their
cover job most of the time *end* Their cover is their occupation their service as a mind-controlled slave is
almost an unwitting avocation *end* Organizations are used as covers *end* The Illuminati use military social
intelligence education banking and other organizations as covers *end* See my Be Wise As Serpents book
for many of these *end* Moriah’s front organizations such as the CIA in turn use other organizations *end* Here is just a sampling of CIA fronts to show the variety of fronts used

· Asia Foundation was an academic organization created by the CIA *end*
· Castle Bank & Trust Co *end* has been a bank in the Caribbean that is a CIA front *end*
· Forum World Features has been a front created for CIA propaganda purposes and based in London
UK *end*
· Geschicter Foundation for Medical Research as well as the Josiah Macy Foundation was used as
an intelligence front to launder money used for mind-control *end*
· Air-Sea Forwarders Inc *end* was the legal corporation name of a CIA front in North Hollywood CA *end* The company was involved in moving freight *end* In the last few years this corporation sued E-Systems
the company which builds the CIA and the NWO’s electronic systems such as their communications
satellites *end* In court the company proved that it was a CIA front in spite of CIA denials *end* As this
chapter provides information about some of the Illuminati/ intelligence connections to Hollywood
bear in mind that this CIA front was proven in court to be a CIA front in Hollywood *end* A feat that
rarely occurs *end*


ONE OF THE GREATEST DECEPTIONS OF ALL TIME DISNEY

INTRODUCTION

For years I have heard many Americans say that something is terribly wrong in this country & that
things are "going to pot" and yet Americans can’t put their finger on what exactly is wrong *end* When I
first began to receive reports from victims of Illuminati mind-control about Disney’s involvement in
their mind-control I kept an open ear but I wanted some tangible proof *end* After investigating for
myself there is now no doubt in my mind that Disney the man the movies & the entertainment
parks has been a major contributor to the demise of America while maintaining a very well
constructed front of wholesomeness *end* In this chapter you will learn why Disney is one of the best
deceptions of the Illuminati *end* This author has read a good portion of what is available to the public
concerning Disney *end* This exposé is undoubtedly the deepest on Disney that has ever been done *end* Perhaps part of my motivation is that I’ve tired of Christians talking and acting like Disney stands for
sainthood *end* Christians who should have known better are some of the ones who have swallowed
"hook line and sinker" the enormous deception that entails Disney *end* They feed their children a steady



diet of occultism and witchcraft because they have been programmed to think of Disney as
wholesomeness and everything that is good about America *end* Many writers over the years have tried to
expose Disney most have been stopped before they could get their books published *end* The few authors
who have managed have faced vicious attacks on their character & integrity and have faced
enormous struggles against public relations campaigns paid for by the Disneys *end* The Disney’s power
and the power behind them has frightened most people away from challenging them *end* But someone
needs to speak on behalf of the victims *end* Whether anyone listens or not the victims will know that
somebody cared enough to stand up & write the truth *end* Disney has not only left mind-control victims
in its wake but they have harassed land-owners stolen employee idea’s and left all kinds of hurting
victims in their path *end* Disney has risen to become the unquestionable largest media-entertainment
conglomerate in the world & was ranked company no *end*  in the top  companies by Forbes  *end*
Observations about HOW THE ILLUMINATI LIKE TO HIDE BEHIND PERFECT
FRONTS *end*
There are numerous Illuminati homes restaurants wineries and other institutions that are today
carrying out the same type of strict standards upon their employees that Walt Disney Studios
maintained *end* While Hollywood was immersed in moral filth from the start Walt Disney Studios had
strict standards *end* In the ’s Disney had a dress code that required men in ties and women in sober-
colored skirts *end* If a man looked lecherously at a woman at Walt Disney Studios he risked being
instantly fired *end* Walt was a shining example of the strictest legalism *end* Even during the ’'s if an
employee were caught saying anything considered a cussword such as "hell" they were instantly fired
no matter who they were *end* Walt would not allow his male employees to have any facial hair even
though he himself sported a mustache *end* He never allowed employees to have alcohol at the studios
which might not be a noteworthy standard except that Walt himself drank heavy amounts of alcohol
in his private office at work for decades *end* Initially Walt was very reluctant to have his young artists
who were being trained by Don Graham draw live nude models but reluctantly gave approval *end* Again
the motive was not to serve God but to make sure the Disney reputation remained untarnished *end* With
the power of the establishment media behind Disney Walt had nothing to worry about news about
the nude drawing classes and their detailed drawings never reached the light of day *end* Behind such
strict fronts of legalistic morals cleanliness & soberness you will often find lots of guilt and high
level satanic ritual *end* For instance Hitler who was by the way also a failed artist & who liked
mechanical things more than people obsessively washed his hands many times a day out of guilt
and so did Walt Disney *end* Walt obsessively washed his hands several times an hour every hour *end* Walt
liked animals & his trains more than people *end* This author has seen some alters who were forced to take
another human’s life and when they relived the memory the alters then tried to physically wash the
blood guilt off of their hands *end* Another example is that over the years this author has discovered that
many of the exclusive restaurants that are meticulous in every detail are tied in with the mind-control
and criminal activities of the elite *end* Dirty money is keeping the places looking sparkling clean *end*
Walt Disney worked very hard at maintaining a great image for himself and his company *end* An
example of this is how he exploded in rage and wrote an angry memo when a Disney character was
placed in a beer ad *end* Memo mentioned in Thomas Bob *end* Walt Disney An American Original *end* Hyperion  p *end*  *end* He had a personal image builder Joe Reddy who worked full time to build
Walt’s image *end* Joe Reddy was a cigar-smoking irishman who loved the catholic college Notre Dame’s
football team *end* He also was a publicity agent for Shirley Temple *end* But the Disney deception entails far
more than Joe Reddy’s decades of image making and Walt’s own abilities to create good images of
himself *end* Just as with Billy Graham see Vol *end*  about Billy Graham the entire Illuminati threw their
weight behind promoting Walt Disney *end* Ronald Reagan and Walt Disney were good friends and both
cut from the same die in many ways *end* Both men were high ranking Freemasons both came from
socialist backgrounds Ronald’s mother was Eleanor Roosevelt’s best friend & Walt’s Dad was a
socialist leader both were paid FBI informants and both were involved heavily in the abuse of
mind-controlled slaves *end* Walt always generously supported Reagan’s political campaigns and in turn
Reagan did political favors for Walt as Gov *end* of California *end* For instance Disney’s Mineral King
mountain resort needed an access route through the Sequoia Nat *end* Park at a time when there was lots



of congressional pressure to preserve the last stands of redwoods *end* Gov *end* Reagan got his friend Disney
his road through the park *end*
Reagan served as the emcee for the opening day of Disneyland on July   *end* He returned with
Illuminati TV host Art Linkletter for the  anniversary *end* Ronald Reagan & Art Linkletter both
pumped Disney publicly *end* Another slave abuser that spent time with Disney was Bob Hope who
would spend time on the golf course with Walt *end* On the opening day’s telecast cameras showed
Sammy Davis Jr *end* a member of the Church of Satan and Frank Sinatra a mind-control slave
handler driving the pint-sized Disney ears at the Autopia ride *end* When Disney celebrated its fifty yr-
anniversary with a two hour special on May   the program included people like occultist Bill
Campbell and was named "Best of Disney  Years of Magic." For the silver anniversary of Disney
World in Oct *end* ’ the Clinton’s were invited to help open  months of celebrations *end* The theme of
the anniversary celebrations was "Remember the Magic" *end* A Boy’s & Girl’s Club sang ‘When you
wish upon a star’ a popular programming song *end* Hillary Rodham Clinton herself an Illuminati
Grand Dame and a mind-control programmer shared with the audience that she and Bill "first
brought daughter Chelsea to the Magic Kingdom when she was four." Roy E *end* Disney nephew of
Walt told the public that Disney World "is the story of men and women who took hold of a dream
and never let go." There is a double meaning to that *end* Many victims of trauma-based mind-control
have taken hold of the illusions that were programmed into their mind secretly at Disney and never
let go *end* Among the visitors to Disneyland have been all the American Presidents from Eisenhower to
Clinton over a dozen kings & queens as well as Emperor Akihito of Japan Anwar Sadat and Robert
Kennedy who rode the Matterhorn with astronaut John Glenn *end* Both Denmark’s & Belgium’s kings
who are in the Illuminati visited as well as the dictators of Indonesia the Shah of Iran and Ceausescu
of Romania *end* As a side-note Roy E *end* Disney was forewarned by Arab leader that the Shah was to be
deposed *end* Organizations that have been actively working for a New World Order for many years gave
big awards to Walt in his early years such as the B’nai B’rith Man of the Year Award to Walt and
the Chamber of Commerce *end* In  Walt was given the Chamber of Commerce’s annual
Outstanding Young Man" award *end* The establishment’s Yale & Harvard Universities gave him
honorary degrees *end* Walt Disney biographer Leonard Mosley who researched Walt Disney for years
as well as writing books on the duPonts the Dulles brothers and Hirohito wrote in his book on Walt
Disney "The studio publicity machines in the film colony had as usual gone out of their way to try
to persuade me as a writer for a powerfully influential British newspaper that this was a city of
lawless gods and goddesses full of clean-living sanitized stars *end*
"It was even more of a deodorized world at the Walt Disney Studio where the publicity men insisted
their boss was faultless--never drank too much never used a swearword never lost his temper never
quarreled with his wife or family never let down a friend *end* And woe betide anyone who tried to
suggest otherwise *end* Members of the resident foreign and local press risked their jobs if they dared to
write stories inferring that Walt Disney could be domineering implacable and unforgiving as was
the case for instance before during and after the  studio strike *end* The Disney flacks were
capable of exerting heavy pressure on editors and proprietors or through the advertising pages
against anyone who inferred Walt Disney was not the epitome of well-scrubbed and benevolent
perfection." Mosley Leonard *end* Disney’s World *end* New York Stein & Day p *end*  *end* Disney is perhaps
the epitome of Illuminati abilities to create images *end* They have created great images for things Disney
incl *end* Walt Disney Disney movies and Disney’s Amusement parks *end* In some cases these things have
been overrated in other instances the sinister side to them has been carefully hidden *end* In order to make
movies that contain the typical smut of Hollywood sex and violence Disney did a slight of hand and
created subsidiaries which Disney runs which has allowed them to keep their good image *end* They also
never showed the public the hard core porn that was made for years in secrecy for the elite *end* Behind
Disney’s good front lies hard porn snuff films white slavery Illuminati mind-control and the
seduction of several generations into witchcraft *end* Disney’s involvement in these kind of things will be
explained in this chapter *end* Nobody has sold America witchcraft as well as the Disney brothers *end* Movie
after movie has cleverly brought the occult into the warp & woof of American thought all under the
disguise of entertainment *end* For instance it was Disney that brought us cannibalism and told us that it
was a "triumph of the human spirit" a direct quote from Disney’s Touchtone Producer Robert Watts



concerning Disney’s movie "Alive" featuring survivors of an airplane crash who turned to
cannibalism *end* Under the disguise of entertainment & showing us how "triumphant" the human spirit
was they subtly promoted cannibalism *end* Mickey Mouse plays a leading role in "The Sorcerer’s
Apprentice." And yet when this author has suggested that Disney movies aren’t wholesome many
Christian parents come unglued and have gotten angry with this author *end* The deceptive image that
Disney movies are wholesome is a triumph in Illuminati deception *end* Parents would be surprised what
is slipped into cartoons *end* In Disney’s "The Little Mermaid" the castles are male sexual organs *end* In one
cartoon Mighty Mouse is shown without comment clearly snorting cocaine *end* Walt Disney Studios
Chairman Joe Roth is in charge of Walt Disney as well as subsidiaries Touchtone Miramax and
Hollywood Pictures which were all created to camouflage the Disney production of adult films *end* Disney operates in a clandestine manner regarding the promotion distribution and rating of the films
produced by their subsidiaries *end*


DISNEY MAKES MALE PHALLUSES INTO CASTLES *end*
Roth oversaw Disney’s subsidiary Hollywood Pictures’ Evita film *end* Evita has as its main start
"Material Girl" Madonna *end* Madonna is in reality a mind-controlled slave who has appeared in
numerous underground porn/& ritual porn movies *end* This author has an underground catalog from a
porn business that has recently changed its location of business *end* The catalog offered a film of
Madonna performing an actual blood sacrifice *end* She also was the main actress in Disney’s Dick Tracy
film which is reported to be used for mind-control *end* During an Arsenio Hall show Madonna who as a
guest acted dissociative was picked up by the cameras during the show kissing her Baphomet ring *end* Disney controls the products that are associated with the movies of their subsidiaries *end* In Evita’s case
they are marketing hats and other items as just one more of Disney’s countless artificially generated
consumerism campaigns *end* In Ruth Stein’s interview of Madonna Madonna appeared bored with
plugging Disney’s consumer products *end* When asked about the tango dresses and hats inspired by Evita
that popped up in stores after the film Madonna said "Believe me I have nothing to do with it *end* Disney is pushing the whole thing." San Francisco Chronicle // Datebook section *end* In one
interview Madonna states she wants her daughter to grow up knowing Catholicism but she doesn’t
believe that it would be good for her daughter if Madonna narried the father of her child from
Lourdes Carlos Leon *end* In another interview Madonna says "Actually I’m a very good role model
because I say ‘Look these are my standards’..." She then goes on to plug homosexuality same sex
marriage and single families in the interview *end* Walt Disney stated that it plans to release an album by
DANZIG a heavy metal band whose songs contain "dark themes" *end* The Disney press release
announces on its by-line "Mickey Mouse is going heavy metal." Disney’s album BLACK ACID
DEVIL" was due to hit the music stores Oct *end*   during Halloween time *end* According to Disney
this music has no satanic references but does have "dark Gothic and sexual" overtones *end* Glenn
Danzig denies that he is a satanist *end*

Disneyland and Disneyworld are world famous and the pride of America *end* They are also extremely
important programming centers for the Illuminati to create total mind-controlled slaves *end* Disneyland is
also involved with providing a place for rituals porn and other satanic activities *end* In terms of
deception Disney movies and Disney Amusement Parks rate as one of the best deceptions *end* According
to deprogrammed ex-Illuminati slaves the Illuminati in the ’s needed to shift their programming
away from the military bases because too much publicity heat was shined on the military bases *end* Their goal was to have someplace that people from all over the world could come to without raising
any suspicions and a place which would be the perfect cover for many of their criminal activities *end*
According to a witness the Illuminati Programmers got a big laugh out of using Disneyland as a
major Illuminati base for criminal activity *end* Under the disguise of entertaining the world they carried
out money laundering child slavery laundering and mind-control *end* They nick-named Disneyland "the
little syndicate of mind-control." When a child of  or  was kidnapped they could torture the child
and then put him on a ride such as a ferris wheel or carousel that a *end* created dissociation from the pain
while also b *end* going along with some fairy tale programming script *end* An abducted child while waiting
to be picked up from one Illuminati non-parent caretaker by another could be kept happy and
distracted while waiting for the pickup *end* For years Disneyland was an Illuminati center for many of
their world-wide activities *end* Now Disney has created other sites around the world such as
EuroDisneyland  miles east of Paris and Tokyo Disneyland *end* Tokyo Disneyland in  had
million people attend *end* With such hugh crowds it doesn’t take much imagination how the Illuminati
have been able to do sneaky criminal activities right in front of people and the public never sees it in
the middle of all the activity *end* EuroDisney has been a money losing affair but the Saudis who benefit
from its mind-control gave Disney the money to keep it financially in business *end* Walt Disney Records
is the largest children’s record label in the world *end* Disney through their movies books toys records

Mountain was one of the most powerful witchcraft promotions ever made *end* Ducktails which has
deliberate Monarch mind-control triggers written into the script is also broadcast in Poland and the

"Control of commodities such as entertainment and access to commodities translates into control
over people *end* ‘The postmodern US is a massive rush of disconnected commodities each seeking a



moment of our attention." The world of commodities is our soma and entertainment is the current
form of public discourse *end* Walt Disney World spread over  acres of central Florida swamp and
scrub forest ‘is the most ideologically important piece of land in the U.S.’ What goes on here is the

quintessence of the American way *end* It is visited by over  million people a year--not only the major
middle-class pilgrimage center in the US but by far the most important entertainment center in the
world *end* It is clearly Oz utopia as a marketing device."

Two Disney brothers Walt Walter Elias and Roy O *end* Disney have been at the center of the creation
of amusement parks and popular Disney films *end* In more recent times two other men Eisner and
Katzenberg have been notable at Disney *end* Eisner & Katzenberg as well as others will be discussed

impact of the Disney brothers is monumental *end* Mickey Mouse teeshirts can be seen being worn by
natives all over the world *end* Disney World and Disneyland are the quest for a large segment of
humanity who often esteem these amusement parks as the highlight of their life *end* What is highly
esteemed among men is an abomination to God according to the Word of God *end* The Bible arbitrarily
makes this claim but sadly research by this author over the years proves that a close examination of
Disney & mankind’s esteem for "Disney" things does vindicate the Biblical expectation *end* In other
words as readers of this article will find out behind the appearance of wholesomeness of the Disney
brothers and their creations lays abominations-- some of the most grotesque aspects of generational
occultism the world has ever seen *end* Disney’s Magic Kingdom has become an American Institution that
impacts people all over the world from the cradle to the grave *end*


C *end* WHO WAS WALT DISNEY *end*
In the large book The Art of Walt Disney from Mickey Mouse to the Magic Kingdom by Christopher
Finch N.Y *end* Harry

N *end* Abrams  on page  an interesting and revealing statement is made "By definition public
figures are known to everyone; yet even after talking with some of Disney's closest associates it is
impossible to escape the conclusion that nobody really knew him *end* Always there was some aspect of
his personality that was just out of reach."

Those who got to know Walt too closely make complaints such as he was "self-satisfied intractable
and arrogant." He could bring his artists to tears or anger in a matter of seconds *end* Finch is not the only
author who has tried to warn his readers that the public’s image of Walt Disney was just that--only a
false image *end* Mosley also writes in his biography of Walt Disney "Since Disney is regarded by
millions of people particularly in the United States as perhaps this century’s most brilliantly
successful creator of screen animation I think I should make one thing clear right away *end* I share the
general admiration of a man whose cinematic achievements were always so happily inspired and
inspiriting *end* But--and this is where I differ from uncritical idolaters--I have to know all the facts no
matter how unpalatable as well as the romantic myths about any great man or woman I admire *end* Many
of the myths that have been created by his publicists about Walt Disney are unpalatable unbelievable
and unsatisfactory because so much of the real Walt Disney has been deliberately concealed. *end* .Walt
Disney...had grave flaws in his character." Mosley *end* Disney’s World pg *end*  Years ago an Illuminati
Grand Master and programmer stated "If the world only had the eyes to see the fibers which lay
under the surface of Walt Disney’s image they’d tar and feather him and drag him through the
streets *end* If only they knew what Disney’s primary goal s."





PERSONAL DETAILS

Walt had black hair with a black mustache and bright quick eyes and was about ’ tall *end* He used his
own facial features to clue artists on how to draw Mickey Mouse’s features *end* He liked specially rolled
brown cigarettes which he smoked up to  a day *end* He picked up the smoking habit in the army *end* He
loved expensive Scotch Whiskey red sunsets and horses *end* He had a vacation home in Palm Springs
CA called the Smoke Tree Ranch *end* He often wore the Ranch’s letter STR emblazoned on his necktie *end* He played lots of golf with Bob Hope and Ed Sullivan at the ST Ranch *end* His main home was an estate

business families lived *end* It was located between Bel-Air an occult word for Satan & Beverly Hills *end*
Walt spent many of his nights at the Disney Studios and later he had his own private quarters at the
center of Disneyland *end* He had reoccurring bouts of insomnia *end* For his nerves and insomnia he’d take
alcohol and tranquilizers *end* He’d go weeks on end without stepping foot on the Holmby Hills estate
and seeing his family *end*
The main topic at the studio by the staff during different time periods was Walt’s bizarre behavior--
he would not be available until late afternoon when he would emerge from the studio’s subterranean
maze of tunnels where supposedly he was "chatting with the maintenance engineers" everyday *end* The
value of his estate when he died was  million dollars of which Lillian his wife inherited half *end* In his
later years when Disney took a vacation he went to Paris for  weeks and  weeks at the Hotel du
Cap in Antibes and then cruised on Fritz Loew’s yacht with Ron and Diane Disney *end* In England
Walt spent time with the British Royal family and met privately with masonic prophet H.G *end* Wells *end* In
Rome Walt visited privately with the Pope and the dictator Mussolini *end* In  Walt Disney died *end* Prior to his

death he had investigated cryogenesis--being frozen and it is believed by some that his body is frozen
somewhere in California while others claim he was cremated *end*


MICKEY MOUSE

According to one source the inspiration for Walt to create Mickey Mouse came when he was
unemployed and saw a mouse in the gutter *end* There are quite a few stories in circulation as to where the
idea came from *end* Ub Iwerks claimed he thought Mickey up at an animator’s meeting in Hollywood *end* Walt once said "There is a lot of the Mouse in me." biographical article written by Elting E *end* Morison p *end*  In fact Ub Iwerks told Walt that Mickey Mouse "looks exactly like you--same nose
same face same whiskers same gestures and expressions *end* All he needs now is your voice." Walt
often did serve as Mickey’s voice *end* A book put out by Walt Disney Co *end* in  reveals that Walt
Disney told Ward Kimball "Quite frankly I prefer animals to people." Walt usually was the voice
behind Mickey Mouse even though he wasn’t the artist *end* His mother was chilly for years about the
work Walt did *end* Around  after much pleading he finally got her to watch Mickey Mouse *end* His
unsupportive mother which he would within a few years learn was not actually his biological
mother told him she didn’t like Mickey Mouse’s voice to which he told her it was his and then she
responded by saying he had a horrible voice *end* The "cold towel" she threw on Mickey Mouse helped
convince Walt to quit making Mickey Mouse cartoons *end* Very few came out of Disney after that and
the very next Mickey Mouse full-length feature cartoon Fantasia had Mickey mostly silent *end*
Walt’s idea for The Sorcerer’s Apprentice was based on some of his own ideas *end* Walt had had the
dream which was used for Mickey Mouse in The Sorcerer’s Apprentice of having "complete control
of the earth and the elements." Disneyland and Disneyworld were partial fulfillments of that dream
for control *end* Walt’s final pet project just prior to his death was the meticulously restored version of the
witchcraft film Bedknobs and Broomsticks." Disney Magazine Winter - pub *end* by Disney p *end*
mentions this *end* As a programming device Mickey Mouse works well because it plays on the
subconscious genetically transmitted fear of mice that women have *end* Mickey’s image can help create a



love-hate relationship which is so valued during the traumatization & programming of mind-
controlled slaves *end*
Some sources state that Walt’s love for animals came from the time his family had a farm near
Marceline Missouri *end* Walt began his schooling at Marceline but continued it after the age of eight at
Benton School in Kansas City MO *end* Walt’s Dad had a serious gambling problem and passed the spirit
of gambling to his son Walt *end* Walt never graduated from high school *end* He had a natural love and a flair
for art work although contrary to his public image he never became proficient at it *end* He joined the
army in W.W *end* I as an ambulance driver by lying about his age *end* During the war he also chauffeured
dignitaries *end* He also did some other things that are very revealing *end* He enjoyed drinking & gambling
while in the service and he ran a scam where he doctored German artifacts picked up on the
battlefield to sell to people *end* War relics were tampered with to get them in shape to get the most
money from them possible *end* Walt took the battle souvenirs - and dressed them up for instance coating
the insides of helmets with grease hair & blood and putting holes in them to make them into
expensive souvenirs *end* This shows that Walt was willing to build illusions if it paid *end* He could be
deceptive if he saw an advantage to it *end* From gleanings from things Walt said to people it appears that
as a child he’d seen the darker side of life for instance his father had a habit of beating him in the
basement and had had some interest or exposure to magic as a child *end* Bob Thomas writes "Walt took
a boyish delight in playing tricks on his parents *end* He was fascinated with magic tricks..." Walt Disney
An American Original p *end*  *end*
After the military Walt hoped to have a career as an artist *end* He applied to the advertising agency of
Pesman-Rubin *end* Roy his brother claimed that Pesman-Rubin hired Walt as a personal favor to Roy
who handled the agency’s account at the bank Roy worked at *end* Walter lasted a month until the
advertising agency let him go due to Walt’s "singular lack of drawing ability." According to Current
Biography  in  Walt and Roy had together  *end* They borrowed  from another
Disney one of their uncles named Robert Disney and began to try to make cartoons *end* Robert Disney
had retired in the L.A *end* area in Edendale CA after a successful mining career *end* Robert had always been
close to Walt’s father Elias and helped Walt and Roy out when they came to California *end* Walt loved
to study Charlie Chaplin a member of the Collins family *end* He scrawled notes about his body
language facial features and his gag methods *end* He also read everything he could about animation and
cartooning *end* They worked out of their uncle’s garage in Hollywood CA *end* They were finally able to
make a good cartoon Steamboat Willie in  which became an instant hit *end* As with many things in
life the cartoon was not only good but Walt finally had the right connections." On Nov *end*  ’
Steamboat Willie was shown in a small independent theater without any advance promotion or
advertising *end* But amazingly *end* the New York Times Variety and Exhibitor’s Herald all ran rave
reviews of the cartoon the next day *end* Was this an accident *end* did journalists from all these prestigious
periodicals just happen to go to this tiny independent theater *end* no it was connections *end* The reason the
elite decided to promote Walt Disney after Steamboat Willie came out as Hollywood’s newest "boy
wonder" was to deflect enormous bitterness that had been generated by the Stock Market collapse
toward Jewish financiers *end* Hollywood even in its first two decades was known as "Babylon" and "Sin
City" *end* The movie industry was well-known to be run by Jews and many people blamed the Stock
Market Crash on the moral degradation that Hollywood had introduced to this nation *end* There were
calls for government regulatory groups to stop the smutty Hollywood films *end* Edgar Magnin the
spiritual leader of the major movie makers who were part of the Los Angeles B’nai B’rith reportedly
encouraged those in the Mishpucka and others who were B’nai B’rith movie makers that Hollywood
needed to protect itself by putting Walt Disney in the limelight as a Christian "white knight with
family values" *end* By the way Edgar Magnin was nicknamed "Rabbi to the Stars" because he was "the
Hollywood rabbi" *end* E *end* Magnin’s grandfather’s department store chain was one of the first major
accounts of the Bank of Italy and Edgar Magnin had continued his family’s close association with the
Bank of Italy *end* The closeness also came from the Bank of Italy’s close ties to the B’nai B’rith and
ADL *end* In  the movie industry made a production code which stated that the industry must make a
special effort to make movies appropriate for children *end* Hollywood directly praised Disney in that
code as an exemplary model of what the movie industry wanted to do *end*


With the power of the B’nai B’rith and ADL behind him Walt began sailing to fame *end* Movie studios
that had been turning out smut with lots of sex and violence all jumped on the bandwagon to show
Walt’s clean wholesome cartoons *end* Walt was the facelift Hollywood needed after the Depression
caused Americans to think about America’s morals *end* Many of the regular movie makers were so
corrupt they were out of touch with moral issues but Walt Disney knew black from

white *end* The Jewish movie makers "pushed the man Walt they considered their best hope to the front
of the pack" who was billed as a fundamentalist Christian albeit a masonic "Christian" who rarely
stepped foot in a church *end* quote from Walt Disney Hollywood’s Prince of Darkness p *end*  *end* Strangely the biographies indicate that Walt quit doing the actual drawing in  and Walt devoted
himself entirely to the development of the cartoon business such as raising money *end* In other words
the image of Walt Disney being the artist who has created the Disney cartoon’s is inaccurate *end* The
Disney brothers actually hired many other artists to do the art work *end* If Walt quit drawing in  and
their first marketable cartoon was in  that clearly shows that Walt did not do the actual
cartooning *end* He continued to oversee the work walking in and rigidly inspecting what was being done
to suit his own intuitive tastes *end* Actually the genius cartoon artist animator who made Walt Disney a
success was Ub Iwerks about whom Walt on a number of occasions said was "the best animator in
the world" *end* Without Ub Iwerks to take Walt’s ideas and turn them into reality Walt would never have
become famous *end* Ub was an incredible genius who had a sense of line a sense of humor patience
organization and a great sense of what Walt wanted *end* Walt treated him cruelly at times interrupting
him playing tricks on him and not being totally honest with paying him but he stayed with Walt
over the years and made Walt the success Walt became *end* The books Disney’s World and Disney
Animation The Illusion of Life have information on the unheralded genius Ub Iwerks *end* Another
unknown great artist was Floyd Gottfredson *end* Floyd Gottfredson drew all the Mickey Mouse cartoons
from  until October --which is a period of  / years *end* Floyd Gottfredson was a Mormon
born in a railway station in  and raised in a tiny Mormon town Siggurd  miles so *end* of Salt
Lake City *end* In  before Floyd totally took over the Mickey Mouse drawings he would take
suggestions from Walt on what to draw *end* For instance Walt puzzled him by insisting he do a cartoon
series of Mickey Mouse committing suicide *end* Floyd had said "Walt You’re kidding!" But Walt
thought that a series on suicide would be funny *end* Over the years the Walt Disney products never
mentioned Floyd’s name *end* The bulk of the fans were led to believe Walt did the cartooning of Mickey
Mouse himself *end* See the book Walt Disney’s Mickey Mouse in Color *end* Ed *end* Bruce Hamilton pub *end* The
Walt Disney Co *end*  *end*
Fred Moore was involved in the creation of Pluto and some other cartoon characters *end* The idea for
Pluto was Walt’s and it was Norm Ferguson’s genius at drawing that took the idea and created the
actual images *end* Walt Disney was awarded  personal academy awards for the work that was done by
his studios *end* Walt Disney’s famous signature was actually designed by someone else and was taught
to Walt *end* Schickel Richard *end* The Disney Version The Life Time Art and Commerce of Walt Disney *end* NY  p *end*  *end* Walt could only make a crude Disney signature so he delegated the writing of the
signature to several artists including Bob Moore Disney’s publicity artist *end* Later after much practice
he learned to make it well enough to do for publicity *end* Many people who wrote letters asking for his
actual signature and who actually did his signature thought that they had received forgeries by his
staff because the famous Disney signature was so crude *end* The nicer looking ones were the forgeries *end* One cartoon animator who joined Disney in  recalled that Walt told him the first day "You’re
new here and I want you to understand just one thing *end* What we’re selling here is the name Walt
Disney *end* If you can swallow that and always remember it you’ll be happy here *end* But if you’ve got any
ideas about seeing the name Ken Anderson his name up there its best for you to leave right away."



OCCULT PORN KING

Walt grew up fascinated with the occult and in an abusive home situation *end* He was fascinated with
cartoons nature and children *end* He had an intuitive sense for quality cartoons that would appeal to
children *end* At some point the syndicate got him indebted to them *end* At that point he was their man *end* He



owed them a debt that they held over him *end* In secret Walt became a porn king *end* A victim remembers
that he was sadistic and enjoyed snuff porn films *end* His interest in children was far from altruistic *end*
The Hapsburgs of the  Illuminati bloodline had a sex salon in Vienna where a porn photographer
named Felix Salten worked *end* Felix Salten wrote a book Bambi which was then translated into English
by the infamous communist Whittaker Chambers *end* The elite were just beginning to form the roots for
today’s environmental movement *end* The book appealed to Disney because Disney liked animals better
than people *end* In the book tame animals view humans as gods while the wild and free animals see
humans as demons who they simply called "Him." The book begins with both free and tame animal
viewing humans as rightly having dominion over them *end* In the end the animals view all humans as
simply being on the same level as animals a vicious animal only fit to be killed *end*
Disney instructed his animators to make the animals "to be human *end* I want people to forget they are
watching animals." Bambi was to receive a Christ-like manger birth with the animals hailing him as a
"prince." Due to his sexual problems Walt at one point permitted himself to be subjected to the
packing of his genitals in ice for hours at a time *end* Elliot Walt Disney Hollywood’s Dark Prince p *end*  *end* Children were instructed to call Walt "Uncle Walt." An example of this were the Mouseketeers *end* For those who know how mind-control programmers have traditionally liked to be called "uncle" by
their child victims the insistence by Walt to be known as "uncle" is distasteful *end* From what this author
has learned from some sources about Walt’s non-public life as a hidden sadistic porn king it raises
questions about other parts of his life *end* For instance Kenneth Anger in his book Hollywood Babylon
II p *end*  "Some animators stated that the boss Walt Disney seemed to have fallen in love with the
boy *end* There may be some truth in this..." The boy who Walt fell in love with was a small young
attractive boy actor named Bobby Driscoll who signed up in  with Disney *end* He acted in Song of
the South Treasure Island and Bobby’s voice was used in Peter Pan *end* Bobby Driscoll was very
intelligent and attractive *end* Did Disney help or abuse him *end* If Disney was such an upbuilding
wholesome atmosphere & this child actor had everything going for him why did Bobby become a
methamphetamine addict at  & die within just a few years *end* Why didn’t his talent & early career
lead to something positive in his life *end*
From those who knew Walt personally one learns that he had an obsession with the buttock part of
anatomy *end* He enjoyed jokes about this part of the anatomy which he told to his staff quite frequently *end* The staff edited out many of his crude posterior jokes from cartoon scripts *end* Two examples that got by
the editors are a Christmas special where a little boy is unable to button the drop seat of his pajamas *end* The little boy’s problem in maintaining his modesty is the running gag of the cartoon *end* In the end
Santa gives him a champer pot *end* The nd example is the paddling machine used on the wolf in The
Three Little Pigs *end* Numerous Disney cartoons feature buttocks of characters provocatively twitching *end*


AS A WITNESS BEFORE CONGRESS

After W.W *end* II Walt Disney was called upon by Hollywood to testify in their defense at the Un-
American hearings which were being carried out by congressmen who were concerned about the
heavy communist influence within Hollywood *end* Walt downplayed any communist influence in
Hollywood to

Congress *end* Interestingly Walt’s father was an outspoken Socialist Party leader in the United States
who advocated a socialist New World Order *end* He regularly voted for socialist presidential candidate
Eugene Debs *end* One of the first drawings Walt did as a boy was to duplicate the socialist political
cartoons he found in a socialist periodical Appeal to Reason that his father subscribed to *end* When Walt
asked in the ’s how his father felt about socialism’s successes his father Elias said "Today
everything I fought for in those early days has been absorbed into the platforms of both the major
parties *end* Now I feel pretty good about that." Thomas Bob *end* Walt Disney An American Original pg *end* - Walt’s movie Alice’s Egg Plant  was pure communist doctrine where the red hen
communist leads the working chickens on a strike against Julius the farm manager representing



capitalists *end* The strike at Disney and unionization of Disney in  soured Walt toward
communism *end* The workers at Disney publicly made personal verbal attacks on Walt & he never
forgave the humiliation *end* In spite of his public distaste for communism his Magic Empire his castle
where he was king was run like a socialist dictatorship similar to what the NWO plans *end* Employees
at Disney did not have titles; it was faceless egalitarianism with an all powerful dictator Disney at the
top *end* It was racially elitist too *end* The only full-time African-American during Walt’s lifetime at Disney
was a black shoe shine man *end* Was Walt a socialist of the National Socialist Nazi variety *end* Arthur
Babbitt claims "On more than one occasion I observed Walt Disney and Gunther Lessing there at
Nazi meetings along with a lot of other prominent Nazi-afflicted Hollywood personalities *end* Disney
was going to meetings all the time." Lessing was mobster Willie Bioff’s crony *end* Bioff had spent his
earlier days running a whorehouse before coming to Hollywood for the mob *end* In the final panel of the
Mickey Mouse comic strip of // a swastika appeared *end* Some people have wondered what this &
other "secret signals" in Disney’s work meant *end* Disney was not Illuminati *end* The powerful elite are very
skilled at controlling people that rub shoulders with them those who are beginning to become
independently wealthy *end* For instance they destroyed Robert Morris the great financier of the
American Revolution *end* They simply used Hegelian Dialectics on Walt Disney *end* Their Unions and the
Mob made Disney’s studio one of their prime targets *end* In order for Walt to protect himself from the
unions which he perceived as communist Walt got help from the FBI and the mob *end* Walt was
vulnerable to the unions because he treated his workers terrible with long hours low pay in addition
to repeated abuses to their dignity *end* Walt’s large number of employees essentially never received any
credit or recognition for their years of creativity and hard work which was all essentially stolen and
credited to Walt by the establishment to build his image *end* I write "essentially" because someone
might find some obscure exception but across the board Walt got all the credit for what his creative
workers produced *end* Perhaps Walt needed the ego boost from all the purloined public praise which he
stole from his staff to be seen as a great animator because he had wanted to be an artist/cartoonist and
failed *end* The praise helped sooth the wounds *end*
One worker recalls that Walt "had no knowledge of draftsmanship no knowledge of music no
knowledge of literature no knowledge of anything really except he was a great editor." This may not
be much of an exaggeration because Walt was a high school drop-out who grew up in poverty on a
Missouri farm *end*
Walt’s first official attempt to direct a film and last was the film The Golden Touch in  *end* The
film was an embarrassment *end* Walt had to pull it from distribution *end* If Walt lacked abilities to animate
and direct what was Walt’s talent *end* Walt was the driving force the spirit so-to-speak behind Disney *end* He was the dictator who was feared enough to demand more from his workers than they knew they
could give--and he could get it *end* He was the driving force that took a mob of artists and gag creators
etc *end* and shaped them into a powerful force to make cartoons and later movies *end* He was the hard-
driving genius who knew what he wanted and got others to create it for him *end* He was the driving force
that kept an army of costumed sanitation men meticulously cleaning Disneyland *end* In normal year
Walt would have  plants replaced at Disneyland & Walt refused to put up signs asking the
"guests" visitors not to trample them *end* How powerful was Walt *end* Here is a man who during his
lifetime and even up into the ’s had a rule in the studio & Disneyland that no male employees
could have any facial hair yet he himself wore a mustache for most of his life *end*


A possible CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS surrounding WALT DISNEY'S ILLEGITIMATE
BIRTH

It is beyond doubt that Walt Disney was an illegitimate child but that fact resulted in a long list of
mysterious happenings *end* It also gave power hungry men something to blackmail Walt Disney with *end* Because this chapter  on Deception is focusing on Disney and the big boys used blackmail to keep
Disney in line this information is pertinent *end* The following chronology of events is what this author’s
believes most likely happened *end* Without any genetic tests it is difficult to determine beyond a shadow
of a doubt who Walt’s biological parents were and what the actual history of Walt Disney was *end*


Several people have spent many years investigating the real facts surrounding his birth *end* Many
interesting and tantalizing clues have been found *end* This author believes that the following chronology
is suggested by the evidence *end* This author’s chronology is offered without hundreds of pages of
evidence because the mysteries around Walt Disney’s birth are here to stay no matter what excuses
people come up with and this author doesn't want to stray from the intended purpose of the chapter *end* This is to show that Walt Disney had a secret bastard birth which gave J *end* Edgar Hoover --and his
superiors-- blackmail leverage over Walt Disney *end* Walt may also have had gambling debts and an
abnormal sexual appetite which also helped entrap him *end* For those who want more evidence and facts
the following are recommended Almendros Mojacar Corner of Enchantment p *end* ; Interview
magazine no *end*  ""Walt Disney Was from Almeria"" and last but not least Eliot Marc *end* Walt

California to a Franciscan monastery *end*

than have the family's reputation their marriage and their family ruined *end* The son doesn't look like the
first two boys at all *end*
--Isabelle and Elias have another bastard son who Elias brings home and names Walter after the
minister of the church he attends *end* The two bastard sons do not look like the older sons of Elias and
they never have much to do with them but cling to each other as brothers *end*
--The minister of the church Elias attends finds out about the bastard children and Elias quickly
moves out of state so that the scandal will remain secret *end* Elias has also run up gambling debts *end*

care of the two boys *end*
--J *end* Edgar Hoover is busy involved with the prosecution of draft dodgers in WW I and it crosses
his desk about the case of Walt Disney committing the crime of forging his parents signature to join

resources in the future for Hoover *end* That year Walt discovered that he had no birth certificate *end* Waft
observes his parents strange reactions concerning his birth certificate & other questions & begins to
deeply distrust his father *end*
Nov *end* --Walt's mother dies by gas and the Disney's maid pulls Elias to safety from the fumes but
Walt's mother dies *end*
---Hoover offers Walt Disney to help Walt locate his real parents if Walt will work for the
FBI *end* Either Hoover already knows that he is a bastard child or he soon learns the truth from an
investigation *end* This gives Hoover blackmail power over Walt Disney and assures Hoover that Waft
will be loyal *end* Hoover informs Walt Disney of the truth and then moves to generously protect Disney
& his father's reputation *end* Two FBI men plant baptismal information of a child born to Isabelle in
named Jose Guirao in Mojacar Spain *end* This date is  years off of Walt's birthdate and is intended to
throw people off track *end* They can't plant a fake birth certificate for Waft in the records for

Walt in the Illinois State records in the year  *end* They hope people will think that somehow a filing
error occurred *end* This way if anything leaks and worst came to worst Waft could at least pretend he
was adopted and is not an illegitimate bastard *end* They pay off townspeople in Mojacar to tell a
particular story *end* Townspeople probably receive ongoing payments *end*
--Walt confronts his father with the truth and his father commits suicide and his real mother
comes to live with him as his maid *end*
--In order to reinforce the myth that Walt was born in Spain a group of Franciscan monks goes
to Mojacar and visibly inquires about the birth records of Jose Guirao and/or Walt Disney *end* They
spend time with the mayor and make sure that everyone connects Waft Disney with Jose who is a
fictitious nominal character that the FBI has created records of *end*
--A year after Walt's death a large group of Americans a large group was needed because they
are not skilled like the  FBI men in  pretend to be on "official" business for the American
government *end* They go to Majacar Spain to destroy all the records of Jose Guirao to insure that there
will be no spanish claimants to Walt Disney's fortune *end* Later to insure that the fictitious story is solidly
in place to mislead the few who might get by the cloud of secrecy over Walt Disney the Spanish
government does a favor to certain powerful people and pays an investigator to investigate the
spanish origins of Walt Disney *end* People of the village willingly tell people without any fear or without
any fanfare that Walt Disney was born at their village *end* Unless they have recently done so the village
has never done anything--no monuments no markers or anything about the birth site of Disney *end* They
probably didn't do this for years because some of the village probably knew it was a lie *end* With the
older people gone the lie has probably become well entrenched as truth and there is most likely some
type of memorial to Walt Disney *end*
WALT DISNEY’S CHARACTER

Because the Disney deception is such a major Illuminati deception worldwide and because Walt
Disney was the major catalyst behind all the Disney theme parks movies trinkets etc *end* it is of
importance to examine his character *end* In studying historical figures this author has tried to get to the
rock bottom truth *end* One may ask how can this be done *end* -especially since there have been decades of
myths spread by the establishment and their media *end* The following procedure which has worked with
other historical figures was also done by this author with Walt Disney *end* The first part of this author’s
own procedure is to study everything that one can find on the man paying special attention to what
bias and vantage point another author comes from *end* Special attention is also paid to biographers who
try to give the whole truth as they have found it rather than approved biographies that repeat myths
platitudes and flattery *end* The investigator has to be careful because there are authors who deceptively
say in their introductions that they are "detached investigators" who are "going to be painfully honest
in their reporting" when they actually are skillful coverup artists for the person they write about *end* When your author Fritz Springmeier finished investigating written material about Walt Disney then
I mentally

placed what I knew on the shelf temporarily and did a handwriting analysis based on the scientific
principles of Graphoanalysis as well as the broader field of Graphology *end* This author is a Certified
Graphoanalyst who has done handwriting analysis professionally *end* Using Graphoanalysis/graphology
is an excellent way to get an unbiased very deep look at a historical figure *end* It is a way to by-pass all
the propaganda and myths *end* However a close historical look and the handwriting analysis of various
historical figures have always matched each other as they did in this case too *end* Here is what was
found *end* The following paragraphs are how Walt was in the ’s *end* The personality profile you will
read did not endure *end* Under the pressure of micromanaging Disney Productions as well as living with
financial stresses by the ’s Walt could be found in rages giving rough treatment to his wife and
rough spankings to his two children *end* He went to psychiatric counseling to cope with the stress *end* And
unfortunately with the progression of time by the ’s Walt had become a sadistic egotistical
alcoholic *end* One biographer described him as ...a bully and a know-it-all" Disney’s World p *end*



Even then Walt had men working for him such as Bill Walsh who had been a orphan as a child who
worshipped Walt *end* But here is how he was in the ’s

Walt was a self-motivated individual with lots of energy which was constantly seeking some outlet *end* People have written much about this trait of his *end* He was more the giver than the taker in
relationships *end* In the first few years when he was responsible for making business contracts he often
gave away his work without setting prices for profits *end* He even wrote letters to his boss to the effect
that his first priority was good cartoons not profits and that he’d work without profits but he did
want some appreciation for his work *end* That was his sensitive nature showing *end* Walt wouldn’t wait for
others to come up with an idea or someone else to make a move--he was there first *end* He could
communicate his ideas with clarity and ease and move easily from idea to another *end* He would storm
into Disney Productions and spew one idea after another into his workers’ ears *end* He enjoyed
competition *end* He had a quick mind and keen perception *end* He frequently acted on intuition and impulse
taking chances and endangering his own security *end* He frequently gambled all his life savings and
everything he could scrape together on a project *end* Long projects bored him *end* Fortunately the real
tedious work of cartooning was done by a large staff of artists *end* House chores and repetitive chores
bored him and he avoided them *end* He was absolutely a total slob around the house as a bachelor *end* He
was impatient with vague philosophies he liked concrete realities *end* He was difficult to get along with
because he had both a playful side even to the point of cruel practical jokes to his personality and an
aggressive intolerant impatient side that wanted to achieve *end* Naturally people around him were
disconcerted because on a subconscious level they never knew which side of him they would deal
with *end* The reference series Current Biography "Disney" article p *end*  gives the following Walt
Disney quote "We don’t even let the word ‘art’ be used around the studio *end* If anyone begins to get
arty we knock them down." He was geared for action *end* He was always inventing ways to get what he
needed *end* He could be explosive when provoked *end* The old time associates of Walt remember his
explosive temper *end* He was a person of dynamic energy sensuality and keen thinking and a disciple
of the pleasure principle *end*
Because his father was so abusive and misused his position of authority Walt came to be deeply
ingrained with defiance toward authority *end* The themes of his films repeatedly sympathize with those
who rebel against authority and the police and other authority figures are consistently shown as
absurd *end* One way he expressed irresponsibility was with lively dance scenes which has been a hall-
mark of teenage rebellion during the  century *end* "Comic anarchy reaches its fullest

expression in Alice Rattled by Rats which shows what the rats do when the cats goes away *end* He felt
that rules were for others to follow *end* That is one reason he would step outside of the law and commit
illegal acts *end* This is one trait that may be responsible for some of the criminal activities Walt ended up
participating in *end* Walt also didn’t like to be closely supervised *end* He wanted to manage his Disney
Magic Kingdom as if it were his own kingdom *end* He wanted to be an authority figure and indeed
became the dictator of his Magic Kingdom *end* When his workers differed with his own views he felt that
they were infringing upon his own inalienable rights as an individual *end* He was somewhat of a
melancholic temperament that type of perfectionist who still enjoys life *end* He felt a need to protect
himself against intimacy with others *end* He was most home in a setting which he made for himself *end* Walt
had the traits of an executive *end* He was slow to reveal his innermost feelings and definitely set his own
goals *end* Walt was one of those persons that when the going got tough he hung in there *end* Likewise he
would cling to his ideas plans and possessions *end* His stubborn refusal to allow his brother Roy to stop
the creation of Disneyland led to events that split the brothers *end* His determination to succeed was
taken advantage of by the crime syndicates to blackmail him with some debt *end* In order to get his
dreams he was willing to give them what they wanted *end* A clue to Walt’s macabre sense of humor at
times almost a graveyard sense of humor and his high tolerance of seeing pain in others is that Walt
was seriously thinking of volunteering again as a medic after the W.W *end* I fighting in France was over
when volunteers were needed for the Balkan fighting *end* Walt loved animals more than people *end* The only
human being that he had rapport with while growing up on the farm was his Uncle Ed who he called
Uncle Elf who looked like a cross between a leprechaun and a prune *end* Uncle Elf could make animals
sounds and bird whistles to Walts delight *end* Walt loved the charm of the farm and nature and he loved



royalty pageantry and a strict social hierarchy such as Freemasonry provides *end* He often wove a
combination of the barnyard in with royal parades and other trappings of royalty *end* For instance in
Alice the Piper the King Hamlin is a farmer who sleeps in a farmhouse *end* In Puss in Boots the local
king lives in an authentic palace incongruously placed in a village *end* His early film Alice’s Day at Sea
includes both the features of a royal court and an American circus *end* In typical Disney disdain for
authority he pokes fun at criminal fraternal groups with their rituals and passwords in Alice & the
Dog Catcher Alice Foils the Pirates and Alice’s Mysterious Mystery *end* And while he was a secret FBI
agent he went against Hoover’s wishes and poked fun at the FBI’s authority *end* Walt was loyal to what
he believed and could be loyal to those individuals who he deemed worthy of his loyalty but he
didn’t want anyone to have authority over him *end* Walt was a  Freemason & an occultist he was
loyal to that philosophy and loyal in his early years to his older brother Roy O *end* Disney who was a
father figure to him *end* If anyone at the studios agreed with him when he was angry at his brother Roy
he or she risked losing their job *end* Both brothers were protective of each other and felt they were the
only ones who could criticize the other one *end*


D *end* WHO WAS ROY O *end* DISNEY *end*
Roy O *end* Disney was born in  and his brother Walt in  *end* They had three other brothers but
Roy and Walt - were only close to each other and not to their other brothers who didn’t
resemble them *end* Walt was named Walter Elias his middle name derived from his father’s first name *end* The Disney family had immigrated from Ireland to Canada and then to the U.S *end* The father of the
brothers as stated was Elias and their mother of scottish descent who may not have been the
biological mother had the maiden name Flora Call *end* Roy died in  shortly after the opening
ceremonies for Walt Disney World *end* He kept his promises to his brother to build Walt Disney World *end* He reneged on his promises concerning the city of Epcot which was derailed into becoming
EPCOT *end* Roy O *end* during the ’s lived in North Hollywood *end* Roy’s family later located in Napa
Valley CA and was associated with the Illuminati kingpins in the area *end* Napa Valley has been
nicknamed the Valley of Kings *end* This "Valley of Kings" plays a major role in the dirty activities
revealed in this chapter *end* Roy  *end* Disney played a bigger role at Disney Studios than people realize *end* For
example it was Roy O *end* who made the decision to cut  min *end* out of Fantasia so that Walt’s pet
project could be distributed to movie theaters *end* Roy O *end* considered by some insiders as the more evil
of the two brothers kept the financial books for the Disney’s down through the years *end* It is known that
Disney kept two books during the ’s so it is hard to believe anything except that Roy  *end* was
fully aware of how Disney brought in their money *end* The big boys always kept the financial screws to
Walt and Roy *end* The big boys often figured out scams to take their money *end* When the Disney brothers
had an arrangement with Columbia Studio run by Harry Cohn they were advanced  for each
cartoon which cost them an unprofitable  to make *end* Further Cohn liked to cheat them by not
sending them their money and taking a ridiculous amount of time to pay them what he owed them *end* The cash flow problems of the Disney brothers also came from Walt’s desire to keep improving and
upgrading the technology they used *end* When Walt went to color over Roy’s objections Disney’s profit
margin was damaged and the studio was left with shortages of cash *end* In  Walt’s repeated gambles
with cartoon production ideas caused Roy O *end* to say "We’ve bought the whole damned sweepstakes."
From  through  Disney lost money every year *end* In ' he lost  *end* Finally in
things turned

around and the Disney studio made a profit of  *end* Cartoons and movies were not really big
moneymakers for the Disney brothers until it was realized that old films could be replayed on
television *end* Overall from the ’s through the ’s the Disneys may have broke even with animation *end* This is why Disney Studios at Christmas  was unable to pay its payroll *end* Pinocchio cost  *end* million to make in the late ’’s an amount hard to retrieve at that time from the box office and
Fantasia’s original release in the ’’s was a dismal financial failure *end* When Sleeping Beauty was
released in  it was a loser movie goers were apathetic towards it *end* The real money made by the
Disney brothers in the -’s came from the merchandising of Disney products the production
of underground hard porn and the kickbacks from various groups which used Disney for mind-



control programming and money laundering *end* When Walt died his shares in Disney were worth
million *end* His family all in all held % of the stock in Walt Disney Productions *end* Roy o *end* Disney’s
daughter Dorothy Disney Puder & husband Episcopalian Rev *end* Glen Puder purchased property at
Sage Canyon Rd *end* Napa Valley east of Rutherford *end* This is close to the Rothschild’s Opus One
Temple mentioned in VoL  *end* O.J *end* Simpson’s lawyer Johnnie Cochran Jr *end* was in the Rothschild’s
hard-to-enter Opus  when the jury arrived at a decision in O.J *end* Simpson’s case *end* It is very typical for
Mafia families in south Boston to have one family member in the clergy & one full time in organized
crime *end* See author’s Be Wise As Serpents for an expose on the Episcopalian Church which is simply
a branch of Freemasonry *end* All kinds of interesting Mafia figures Illuminati and Bohemian Grovers
live up the Sage Canyon Rd *end* This is an area that has a large well-kept cemetery for pets *end* Frank Well’s
sister and Rich Frank who will all be discussed later in this chapter also live on Sage Canyon Rd *end*


E *end* WHO WAS ROY B *end* DISNEY *end*
Roy Edward Disney nephew of Walt is the son of Roy Oliver Disney brother of Walt *end* Sometimes
he has been called Junior *end* The // Newsweek story on Disney’s Magic Kingdom called him
"Keeper of the Flame." Roy is an executive with Walt Disney Co *end* at   *end* Buena Vista St *end* Burbank

named Patricia *end* He was merely tolerated by his uncle Walt especially after Roy E *end* made some snide
remarks about Walt’s plans for Disneyland which he and his father opposed until Walt Disney
personally got the project going *end* Walt’s son-in-law Ronald Miller is one of the Disney clan who can’t
stand Roy E *end* The two never liked each other and in the power struggle between them after Walt’s
death Roy E *end* won and ended up with Disney *end* Although people called Roy E *end* "Walt’s idiot nephew"
he eventually with the help of his father & outsiders won the various power struggles at Disney after
Walt died and is now a powerful figure *end* Roy E *end* Disney and Stanley P *end* Gold work together in various
ways and are both on the present Disney Bd *end* of Dir *end* They are friends and worked to prevent hostile
takeovers of Disney in  *end* Gold is in charge of Shamrock Holdings Inc *end*


The battle between the two Disney factions

In  the two brothers and their respective sides of the family split when Walt created RETHAW
corporation *end* The two sides have fought ever since *end* When Walt Disney created RETLAW his name
Walter spelled backwards this alienated his brother Roy O *end* & Roy’s side of the family *end* Without
going into all the details what RETLAW did was cut Roy O.’s side out of the money that was to be
made *end* But Roy’s side didn’t stand by and idly let their share of the pie be lost they fought back and
held their own *end* Their big break came when Michael Milken and his band of junk bond artists carried
out a "greenmail" on the Disney Corp *end* Only a few insiders know how greenmail works *end* It is a legal
form of blackmail *end* Milken would work with his friends Saul Steinberg Sir James Goldsmith and
Carl Icahn *end* Milken would provide them the financial clout to make them look financially capable of
financially purchasing a corporation that they had selected as a target *end* According to insiders Milken
got % of the upside of any "greenmail" that went right *end* The targeted corporation would learn that
someone like Saul Steinberg was going to buy them out *end* In order to prevent the buyout and to keep
their jobs the officers of the targeted corporation would get frantic and either do suicidal
refinancings or buy the stock of the potential acquirer for much greater prices than the Milken group
paid for them *end* The "greenmail" artists would then take their loot and go on their way *end* The
stockholders of the targeted company are the real losers of "greenmail" because the management of



the corporation in order to finance their protection spends the stockholder’s money takes on new
debts and deprives the stockholders of some profit-making potential of their shares *end* Michael
Milken’s group made feints to take over a large number of corporations including Walt Disney
Phillips Petroleum and Avco *end* Saul Steinberg made what looked like the beginnings of a sincere
hostile takeover of Walt Disney through Reliance *end* At one point Reliance became Disney’s largest
stockholder *end* Steinberg filed an amended D saying he intended to acquire % of the corporation *end* The CEO of Walt Disney was Walt Disney’s son-in-law Ron Miller *end* Saul Steinberg is a dear
business partner with London’s Jacob de Rothschild *end* Originally Ron Miller Stanford Univ *end* grad *end* and Ray Watson a Bohemian Grove mmbr from Stanford Unive *end* of Walt Disney’s management
brought in the Bass brothers to help them deal with Saul Steinberg’s takeover and to buy and develop
land esp *end* in Florida *end* Ray Watson was Ron Miller’s key right hand man to run things *end* The Bass
brothers are mafia *end* Disney acquired the Bass Brother’s Arvida and brought the Bass brothers into
Disney’s management *end* The Basses sold their stake in Texaco back to the oil co *end* & then used this
money to bolster Disney *end* Sid Bass & Chuck Cobb chief exec *end* Arvida worked out a deal with
Disney *end* Arvida sold to Disney for  mil *end* would profit from developing Disney land in FL &
Disney would profit from the new financial strength that getting Arvida would provide *end* Arvida owned
oil fields theme parks and had helped create planned communities *end* For Ron Miller on the one side
was the Illuminati and the other side of things was the mafia *end* He didn’t trust either but Steinberg’s
takeover could eliminate Disney’s management and both he and Roy E *end* Disney wanted to save
Disney from a takeover by Steinberg *end* At first Roy E *end* wrote a letter to Ron Miller & the other board
members stating his concerns about the acquisition of Arvida For Disney management at least the
Bass brothers would let Walt Disney continue to make their family movies *end* After the Bass brothers
joined the Disney management and became one of Disney’s major stockholders they soon joined
sides with Roy E *end* in a management fallout over whether Disney should buy Gibson Greeting Card
Company *end* With enough votes on the board they sent Ron Miller packing *end* With Ron Miller and those
management men aligned with Walt’s side of the family gone then CEO Michael Eisner Frank
Wells Rich Frank and Jeffrey Katzenberg and some others made the modern Walt Disney
Corporation *end* Disney’s Touchtone studio which was mentioned above in connection to the movie
Alive was created in  by Walt Disney’s son-in-law Ronald L *end* Miller *end* Ron Miller’s management
style was lackluster *end* The new management has really gone gang busters *end* Although Walt’s side of the
family is out of the management end of Disney they still receive financial rewards from various
Disney enterprises *end* The Bass brothers acquired more land for Disney in Florida *end* But under their
tutelage Disney now has a management team that is skilled in land grabbing techniques *end* The Bass
fortune began with Perry Bass who created a company called Bass Enterprises *end* In  Perry retired
and turned things over to his eldest son Sid Richardson Bass *end* Sid has three younger brothers Ed
Robert and Lee *end* The Basses owned % in Prime Computer as well as sizable real estate and oil
holdings *end* The Bass brothers founded a local prep school in Ft *end* Worth TX *end* Their HQs in Ft *end* Worth is
full of modern art *end* The Bass brothers were very clever in their deal with Disney *end* In exchange for their
 investment in Arvida they had gotten over a period of time  million dollars worth of
Disney stock *end* In  they liquidated Bass Brothers Enterprises and divided the assets between the
four brothers *end* Sid Bass was able to shift his interests from finances to culture and high society *end* One of
the Bass brothers is involved with wineries in Napa Valley *end* The Bass Brother’s financial strategist
was Alfred Checchi now of Beverly Hills who has been a supporter of Mishpucka member Sen *end* Dianne Feinstein D-Calif. *end*
Roy is involved in criminal activities and several people investigating him have been bluntly warned
that if they continue they will see their children murdered *end* Napa Valley’s Illuminati activity also
connects in with CIA activities as well *end* The Napa Valley Illuminati families all have CIA
connections *end* For instance British millionaire Kenneth Armitage who had to flee from England to
avoid arrest on numerous charges of theft deception and false accounting had some of his good
friends in the Napa Valley such as Dr *end* John Duff Johnny Beck & others *end* Armitage has since
mysteriously died in prison in England *end* Armitage had intelligence connections which tie in with
twilight world of the criminal activities of the numerous intelligence acronym monsters *end* Also his
company was authorized to provide people with Central American government documents *end* There is
more-- much more to sordid affairs which swirl around Roy Disney *end* Napa Valley where many



members of the Disney family live has the Illuminati’s Opus One temple owned by Rothschilds as
well as two roads lined with meticulously kept wineries owned by Illuminati kingpins and connected

F *end* WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE DISNEY FAMILY IN GENERAL *end*
Several members of the Disney family came to England with William the Conqueror *end* They were not
known as Disney then but because they came from the French Norman town of Isigny they took the
name‘Isigny and anglicized it into Disney *end* Walt had two daughters Diane Marie bn *end* //
and Sharon Mae *end*
Diane made some revealing comments when she said he didn’t spoil us *end* Like a lot of adolescent
girls I was crazy about horses and I got quite good at riding *end* I yearned for my own horse but Dad
wouldn’t buy one *end* And we didn’t have a lot of clothes and other things." For being one of the richest
men in the nation Walt can’t be accused of having spoiled his children *end* He was also famous for his
ten cent tips at restaurants which became the talk of the town *end* Sharon Mae was adopted and arrived
at the Disney home // *end* She died in ’ *end* The adoption was kept very secret *end* The newspapers
around the country announced that Lillian had given birth to Sharon and the Disney family kept up
this lie for years *end* The reason given for Sharon’s adoption was that Diane needed a playmate *end* For
years Walt Disney didn’t care much for Sharon and seldom acted like he even knew her name *end* Walt
had wanted a son but his wife wanted to adopt a girl so it was a beautiful girl that Lillian picked out
to be a companion for her first daughter *end* When Sharon was kindergarten age Walt would take her to
the carousels in Griffith Park on Sunday afternoons *end* Sharon was sent to private schools *end* She went to
Westlake School for Girls and later was shipped off to Switzerland to a girls’ boarding school *end*
She had soft blond locks and was attractive *end* In June of  Walt took Sharon who was then an
attractive  yr *end* old to Alaska with him for about  months *end* For most of this trip Walt and Sharon
were alone together *end* For a father who had ignored Sharon for years now Walt was totally obsessed
with Sharon *end* He bathed Sharon every night combed her hair washed her underwear and carefully
dressed her each night from head to toe before taking her to nice restaurants *end* He even

followed her when she sleep walked *end* Why was Sharon a dissociative person *end* That summer in Alaska
Walt and his personal pilot took a trip in August to Mt *end* McKinley AK *end* Both were drinking scotch
whiskey and they barely missed hitting a mountain and almost ran out of fuel before finding a
runway *end* Sharon first married a presbyterian Robert Borgfeldt Brown *end* Later Sharon went on to marry
William Lund *end* Years later Walt’s wife Lilly even prevented a biographer from revealing that Sharon
was adopted *end* Sharon died relatively young *end* It is important to look at the Disney family rather than just
Walt Disney in trying to understand the Disney phenomena *end* For instance in  the Wall Street
Journal mentioned that Lillian B *end* Disney was beneficial owner of over % of common Disney
stock *end*
Lillian Walt’s widow quietly purchased property in Napa Valley and moved there in the late ’s *end* She bought the property through Walt’s Retlaw Enterprises and the Lillian Disney Trust *end* Lillian and
her  daughters ran Retlaw for years *end* Diane Miller her daughter also bought land and moved to the
Napa area *end* The Lillian Disney Trust bought the Silverado Vineyards which Diane & her husband
manage as gentlemen growers" as they call it *end* This side of the Disney family is shunned by the
Illuminati insiders in the Napa Valley as well as by the Roy O *end* side of the family *end* Although very
private there are occasional moments of publicity from Diane Disney Miller when she donated wine
for a fund raiser for the Planned Parenthood Shasta Diablo held at the estate Niebaum-Coppola

family *end* He owns a big winery & directed Disney’s Caption EO film *end* Locals in the Napa area do not

Illuminati hierarchy *end* Doris Miles Disney has been a writer of occult fiction such as The Magic

novels *end*


G *end* A HISTORY OF DISNEY

"The story of Disney’s silent film career is not so much a struggle for artistic expression as it is a fight
for commercial stability." During the ’s Walt stayed safely within the confines of comic
animation as defined by others such as the producers of Felix the Cat Koko the Clown and Krazy
Kat *end* In other words when many of the ideas were coming from just himself Disney’s movies were
not any better than others *end* In the ’s Disney got some of the best talent available and he began to
settle for only the best results from that talent *end* With the mob and the Illuminati behind him and
driven by an indebtedness to them Disney began to achieve outstanding results in animation *end* Between  and  Walt Disney made a series of  silent Alice Comedies which used three
different girls -year-old Virginia Davis Margie Gay and Lois Hardwick to act as Alice who romps
around in a makebelief cartoon world *end* These cartoons combined live action and animation *end* By the
time the series was done Walt Disney wanted to try working solely with animation *end* Margaret
Winkler in NY who married Charles Mintz distributed Walt Disney’s Alice Comedies *end* From the
beginning children were the center of everything Walt did *end* The occult world that backed Walt as
well as Walt himself believed that if they could bring out "the child" that part of a person called "the
child" by various psychologists then they could appeal to the curiosity and feelings of the "child"
part of adults *end* If it worked with adults they could do the same with the child part in children *end* They
knew even in the ’s & ’’s what had to be accomplished in the secret Great Plan for a New World
Order *end* The Illuminati Great Plan called for family life to be destroyed for children to rebel against
their parents and for the world to become more violent *end* Children needed to immerse in images of
violence so that a violent society could be created *end* For instance the  film Alice Stage Struck
shows little girl Alice strapped to a log leading to a buzz saw *end* They also wanted to make occultism--
witchcraft the common belief of the American people *end* The Illuminati felt they could bring in
witchcraft if they appealed to the curiosity of the child in every adult *end* For instance the Donald Duck
cartoon Corn Chips  shows Donald harassing Chip and Dale who then get back at him by
stealing a box of popcorn and spreading it all over the front yard *end* Now what does a cartoon like this
teach kids *end* It teaches that stealing to repay a grudge is O.K *end* and that doing pranks is funny *end* In
Disney’s  films he shows kids cutting school shoplifting and playing hookey *end* He shows Alice
running away from responsibility to have adventure *end* He shows prisoners escaping and hobos escaping
work *end* His films are expression of misbehavior being successful *end* What does this teach children *end* In the
 cartoon Get Rich Quick Goofy wins money at poker and his initially angry wife who doesn’t
like gambling forgives him when she sees how much he’s won *end* Goofy indicates that they can have a
spending spree by telling his wife "Easy come easy go!" The gambling spirit is a very powerful
spirit that the Illuminati want to instill in this nation *end* How can a cartoon that promotes gambling be
wholesome for children *end* Lt *end* Col *end* Dave Grossman is a military expert on how to condition people so
that they will kill *end* He writes in his superb book On Killing Boston MS Little Brown & Co *end*
that the same process that the government has used to condition soldiers to kill is being used by the
entertainment industry *end* The only major difference is that in the military men are taught to kill only on
command while our children are being taught to kill whenever they want to via TV’s
"entertainment." Grossman states on page  that the conditioning to kill begins with cartoons *end* "It
begins innocently with cartoons and then goes on to the countless acts of violence depicted on TV as



the child grows up.. *end* .Then the parents through neglect or conscious decision begin to permit the

films so dangerous *end* Yes the image of Disney has been that its cartoons are wholesome *end* No wonder
Illuminati mind-control programmers have laughed at how naive the American public is toward

example is given at the end of this chapter *end* The Illuminati and Mafia knew that Walt had the ability to
get the job done that the Great Plans called for *end* Source confidential interview *end* They knew they had
the "carrots and the sticks" to get him to cooperate *end* There is no doubt that Walt was a hard worker
who in turn expected high standards from his employees *end* One co-worker of Walt wrote "Walt made a
simple statement that you can lick them with ‘product’ if you make your product good enough they

outlook toward quality came in April  when the head of Universal Studios wrote a scathing

party for all Disney workers at Lake Norconian near Palm Springs southeast of San Bernandino CA
where the cost of everything the Disney workers wanted to order--food or drink or whatever would
be taken care of by the Disney’s *end* Under the full moon the Disney male and female workers finally
free of the tight rules at the studios had what amounted to a Roman orgy and a large nude skinny-dip
at the lake *end* Almost all of the Disney workers participated in the orgy and Disney had only two
options  *end* fire them all or  *end* ignore that the party took place *end* Walt choose the later option and after
that no-one ever dared mention the party in his presence *end* In  Walt and Roy took a trip to Europe
where Walt dined with the British Royal family & met privately with H.G *end* Wells the masonic
prophet *end* planner of what Wells & other masons called "the New World Order" *end* In Paris the League
of Nations the forerunner to the U.N *end* gave him an award *end* After the success of Snow White Disney
chose Pinocchio to follow it *end* Many have asked why Pinocchio was chosen by Walt *end* If you look at the
script the puppetmaker’s wife is taken out of the original script and there is an emphasis on the little
wooden puppet visualizing becoming a flesh & blood son to the man who had created him *end* Here we
have a boy with no soul who is told if he works hard he will be given one *end* Does this sound familiar
to readers of VoL  *end* The script was definitely changed to have a storyline far more useful to mind-
control programming *end* For those who think Walt simply recreated fairy tales on the screen if one
examines the changes that are made from the original storylines they are changed to make them more
useful for mind-control *end* Both Snow White and Pinocchio have occult type "deaths and resurrections" *end* After W.W *end* II Joseph Rosenberg persuaded A.P *end* Giannini his boss to bankroll Disney again *end* Although Walt was financed by the Mishpucka Jewish Mafia he didn’t like the idea *end* Richard

Disney received the French Legion of Honor for his Mickey Mouse cartoons *end* Also in  the
Queen of England who readers of my previous articles will realize is Illuminati involved in drug

his  Masonic membership and his DeMolay activities helped boost his support and also helped
Walt’s bent toward the occult *end* Let’s digress just to let people in on Freemasonry’s involvement with
acting and motion pictures *end* The famous  Club was a masonic chapter for actors who were
Freemasons *end* Examples of actors who were Freemasons include John Aasen Gene Autry Monte Blue

membership in their

membership sales pitches *end* Because the  Disney brothers’ chief contributions to the production of
Disney films were the finances and occassionally the ideas used in a film it is rather
misrepresentative of things that Walt Disney got all the credit for the success and quality of the
Disney cartoons *end* He was showered with  awards and honors from important people including
oscars and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in ’ *end* Walt Disney’s great animators never got the
credit they deserved but no one should forget that Walt was the driving force that inspired and guided
his workers *end* In  Walt Disney made a cartoon about a goddess of the Mystery Religions named
Persephone *end* In the cartoon entitled The Goddess of Spring the goddess Persephone is captured by
Satan as his bride and sent to the underworld with the agreement she could return to earth six months



of each year *end* The Illuminati have rituals around Persephone *end* On Dec *end*   Disney premiered the
first full-length color cartoon movie "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs." This cartoon had taken
 *end* in depression-time money and three years to make *end* Over  artists worked on the film *end* Walt
Disney had gotten the idea from a silent movie of Snow White which he saw as a boy in  *end* The
movie has an important occult theme to it and has been used for occult mind-control programming *end* When the ’s got started Disney was in financial difficulties *end* At this point Nelson Rockefeller
hired his cartoon capabilities to make cartoons for South America with the idea that South Americans
would remain loyal to the American capitalist hegemony rather than shift to rising ideologies of
fascism/nazism if they saw Walt Disney cartoons *end* In Rio de Janeiro Brazil on // Disney did its
world premiere of Saludo Amigos a  minute feature about Latin America *end* Goofy becomes a
gaucho a parrot teaches Donald Duck to dance the samba as well as Disney art showing various
landscapes of Brazil in the film *end* However the film The Three Caballeros if it was meant to
encourage South American loyalty to American capitalism completely failed *end* The Three Caballeros
showed a sexually lecherous Donald Duck who in bad taste tries to make it with latin women *end* The
mysticism was also seen as bogus *end* Although the latin Americans hated the film the establishment
media’s Look magazine praised it *end* Another reason that Rockefeller sent Walt to South America was
to get him out of the way so that the government could settle the strike by Disney workers *end* Nelson
Rockefeller was the government’s Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs a good position
considering how much of South America the Rockefeller’s controlled *end* Rockefeller told Disney that
Disney couldn’t beat the strikers but that while Walt was in South America FDR would see to it that
the strike got settled *end* When Disney returned he submitted to the powers that were and accepted the
unions and the mafia’s control *end* Another change for Walt Disney was that in  he and Roy turned
Disney into a "public corporation" and initially sold  shares of common stock *end* The Illuminati
Boston firm of Kidder Peabody & Co *end* were the underwriters of the studio’s public stock-offerings *end* By  the Disney Studio at Burbank had become a miniature city with  men & women
employees and  buildings on a

acre tract of land *end* After the U.S *end* joined W.W *end* II Disney Productions were made a part of the
American military establishment *end* The very next day after Pearl Harbor the military moved onto the
Disney Studio which leads this author to suspect that Disney was already part of the power
establishment prior to the war breaking out *end* Disney made military movies/cartoons that taught the
different branches of the military many things *end* They made propaganda movies for the allies *end* One
series of films was "Why we fight." Disney made movies for the IRS to get people to pay their taxes *end* Some of the Disney films were top secret and concerned secret military weapons or secret
psychological tactics of the Americans *end* For instance one military film was "Army Psycho Therapy"
which taught army men how to instill fear and about the basics of fear *end* Another army film was
"Prostitution & the War" *end* Another showed a carrier pigeon evading the Germans *end*
In  Disney came out with  full length animated cartoons Pinocchio and Fantasia both of
which were soon used for Illuminati mind-control programming *end* Fantasia contains Schubert’s sacred
Catholic music Ave Maria which was used in a concluding segment side to side with the profane
Night on Bald Mountain song as well as six other classical pieces of orchestra music *end* As a feature
cartoon it was a flop but as a programming tool it was fantastic *end* Fantasia receives a comprehensive
explanation of how it is used for mind-control programming at the end of this chapter *end* Because an
explanation of the use of a Disney film for mind-control is complex this explanation is placed at the
end of the chapter so that it won’t interrupt the flow of this chapter’s information *end* The Pinocchio film
has been redone and released  times over the years *end* Some of the next full length animated films to
come out were The Three Caballeros  The Adventures of Ichabod & Mr *end* Toad ‘
Cinderella  Treasure Island  Alice In Wonderland  The Story of Robin Hood &
His Merrie Men  Peter Pan

 Leagues Under the Sea  Sleeping Beauty  Very soon after the production of all of
these movies the Illuminati and their intelligence agencies used them for Illuminati total mind-
control programming *end* To see their misuse as programming scripts one has to understand how the
fantasy worlds of a programmed multiple are created and how the movie scripts are adapted to be



programming scripts *end* Vol *end*  gave quite a few examples of how Alice In Wonderland and the Wizard
of Oz scripts were used for programming scripts *end* When Disney had his animal-nature documentaries
he edited and used narration to give the animals human like characteristics--something he’d already
been doing with animation *end* Disney played an important part in the Illuminati’s plan to elevate
animals and dehumanize humans *end* One of the biggest Illuminati kingpins and leader Grand Master
of the Prieure de Sion was frenchman Claude Debussy bn. *end* Claude Debussy a Merovingian
was Nautonnier Navigator-helmsman of the Prieure de Sion from - *end* See the document
Dossiers secrets planche no *end*  Ordre de Sion written about in Holy Blood Holy Grail *end* In
when some secret coded parchments Merovingian documents were found by a french clergyman
Sauniere he was directed by church officials to visit with Emile Hoffet an occult acquaintance of
Debussy *end* Debussy was close friends with many of the top french occultists of his time *end* He is known
to have been a close friend to both the notorious satanists Jules Bois and MacGregor Mathers *end* Mathers started the Order of the Golden Dawn *end* Debussy was also a friend of the infamous Papus aka
Dr *end* Gerard Encausse and W.B *end* Yeats *end* Papus was one of the men who during his lifetime was part of
the interlocking occult directorate of occult groups *end* Claude Debussy put some works of the previous
P.d.S *end* Grand Master Victor Hugo to music *end* Debussy and his other powerful occult friends were
influential with Monsieur Philippe whose Russian occult circle influenced the Russian Czars and
Czarinas before Rasputin came around *end* Debussy travelled to Russia and Rome *end* Some of Debussy’s
works became operas *end* Interestingly Walt Disney was extremely anxious to make a cartoon using
Debussy’s Clair de Lane *end* The work was done but it was never shown to the public *end* Disney never
found a place to use it *end* It was originally done with animation with flying cranes for the occult
extravaganza Fantasia but when the Fantasia ended up too long Clair de Lane was cut and shelved *end* It was again planned for the film Make Mine Music but then Blue Bayou was substituted in *end* Walt
used the Le Sacre du Printemps the Rite of Spring music for Fantasia *end* This piece of music was
written AS a pagan ritual where a virgin sacrifices herself by dancing to death *end* Disney’s mobster
Gunther Lessing had threatened Stravinsky if permission weren’t given for Disney to use the piece of
music it would be used anyway *end* Dr *end* Julian Huxley got involved in the production of Fantasia *end* Aldous and Julian Huxley are well known by conspiracy researchers for their roles in the World
Order *end* In the ’s and ’s the Illuminati began using Disney’s Alice In Wonderland and the
Wizard of Oz films as programming bases for their total mind-controlled slaves *end* Alice in Wonderland
had been done many years earlier by the Britisher William Cameron Menzies who also did
Freemason H.G *end* Wells’ masonic forecast of the New World Order entitled "Things to Come" in
and the film Invaders From Mars. *end* In  Illuminati Kingpin William Randolph Hearst with some
minor help from others funded the Motion Picture Alliance and Walt Disney became a co-founder
and its first Vice-President *end* In the early ’s Walt turned his attention from animated cartoons to
other projects such as True-Life-Adventures television shows and the creation of Disneyland *end* Seal
Island was his first true life adventure which was released to the general public on May   and
soon won Walt Disney an Oscar *end* Alfred and Elma Milotte had shot the film on some Alaskan Islands
named Pribilof Islands *end* James Algar had put the movie together *end* In  Walter spelled his named
backwards to create the name of another corporation Retlaw" *end* Roy and his family saw the move as
an attempt to cut them out of the financial picture *end* In  Walt Disney and ABC made a agreement *end* ABC would directly invest half a million US dollars as well as guarantee  *end* million in loans for the
construction of Disneyland *end* This made ABC / owner of Disneyland *end* In return Walt Disney agreed
to produce a regular television series for ABC *end* Remember too that ABC’s president Leonard
Goldenstein was a good friend of Ronald Reagan *end* On July   Walt and Lillian were attempting
to celebrate their  wedding anniversary at a park and restaurant *end* Walt got too drunk to speak into
the microphone so he blew noisemakers into it while Lillian rushed to pull him out of view *end* In
Disney bought out the ABC investment also labelled Paramount for  *end* million with cash and
notes and to bring this all up to date later on July   Disney merged with Capital Cities/ABC
with Disney in nominal control *end* Actually Capital Cities has long been a CIA front company so the
merger placed Disney squarely within the CIA ranks although it had been in bed with them for the
CIA’s entire history *end* The Illuminati-controlled corporations of Coca-Cola and the drug firm Johnson
and Johnson became sponsors for Disney’s early TV shows *end* On // the Wall St *end* Journal
announced that Atlas Corp *end* got % interest in Walt Disney Productions *end* Walt Disney worked quietly
with some consultants on the concepts behind Disneyland *end* His brother and nephew tried to prevent



the project from happening *end* Later they requested that Walt sign over Disneyland Inc *end* to Walt Disney
Productions which Walt did *end* Walt kept  *end* % of Disneyland holdings and Walt Disney
Productions got the rest *end* Walt Disney Productions then shared their portion with others *end* The man who
helped Walt finance Disneyland was the executive vice-pres *end* of ABC Kintner *end* Walt Disney got the
Illuminati’s Stanford Research Institute to determine what would be the best site for Disneyland *end*
A retired Navy admiral Joe Fowler was in charge of constructing both Disneyland and Walt Disney
World *end* How do admirals fit into the power structure *end* Admirals are briefed each day and are given
information concerning the secret power structure *end* Most men who are at that military level are
Illuminati or at least well controlled by the system *end* Within the last few years there has been an intense
effort to weed out any admirals who are not loyal to the Illuminati *end* Morgan-Evans who lives in
Malibu and who may be of the famous Morgan clan was the one who created the spectacular
landscapes for Disneyland Walt Disney World and EPCOT in FL *end*
According to CIA informants opposed to the NWO CIA contractors were brought in to build the
underground tunnels under Disneyworld in  *end* These contractors were sworn to secrecy but were
only informed on a need to know basis why the CIA was involved with an amusement park *end* To work
on the secret tunnel project took an "Above Top Secret" clearance *end* A major programming center was
constructed under Lake Holden *end* Many of the lakes in Florida are named Lake So-and-so rather than
So-and-so Lake *end* The tunnel system was built for programming trauma-based total mind-controlled
slaves *end* It was built of concrete with steel reinforcement *end* Lake Holden lies just to the northwest side of
the Orlando International Airport and just south of Interstate  *end* It is close to Range E on quad
maps *end* It is only as the crow flies about  miles from Disneyworld *end* In spite of Draconian measures
of secrecy numerous lawsuits Fed *end* & State were filed over the years by victims trying to expose the
Disneyworld programming tunnels so that finally the programming center was dismantled cleaned
up and a maintenance" tunnel level and a casting" tunnel level were opened to the public *end* During
its heyday the programmers military & intelligence men had exotic offices underground with
unusual programming equipment *end* It doesn’t take any imagination to realize that if Disney carried
mind-control programming above and below ground that they would need tight security forces to
protect their secrets *end* Indeed such is the case *end* Disney amusement parks have been granted draconian
powers wherever they have been built *end* The Disney parks have also employed armies of spies dressed
like tourists to spy on Disney’s employees *end* If amusement park workers did anything slightly out of
place they were and still are reported by the spies in the camp and they often have lost their jobs *end* For instance one ex-worker who had  years with Disney was caught discussing his divorce with
another worker *end* Since divorce doesn’t fit the wholesome image that Disney wants when the spy
dressed as a tourist reported his conversation he lost his job *end* Many workers have tried to tell their
personal horror stories of Disney’s draconian rules and their draconian private police force but most
of the time Disney has had the power to suppress and intimidate away any bad publicity *end* An
exception to that is the recent Nov *end*  ‘ Napa Valley Register article on page D entitled "Critics of
Disneyland Say Security Abusive Inside Magic Kingdom." UCLA law professor David Sklansky
commented about Disney’s police "One of the major problems we have is nobody really knows what
they are doing- how often they stop interrogate or search people *end* They are not subject to the same
sort of regulatory controls." It’s almost superfluous to tell readers that Disney’s amusement park with
it’s theme areas such as Fantasyland Tomorrowland and Adventureland were a great success *end* Everyone worldwide was curious to visit this entertainment mecca to participate in something that
had a clean wholesome image to it *end* The entire world system pulled together to insure that Disneyland
got the image and publicity that the top  Illuminati families and the various syndicates wanted it to
have *end* For  years they’ve done this *end* When something that everyone thinks is clean and wholesome is
not attacked by the world system that should raise eyebrows among thinking people *end* Home
schooling learning to read phonetically and other wholesome activities for children have been
viciously attacked and ridiculed by the established media *end* Why has Disney gone untouched *end* Disney
Studios for years strove to have a very clean image *end* Workers had dress codes and any activity on the
part of employees that wasn’t morally conservative was grounds for instant dismissal *end* Of course the
exceptions were well covered up such as an employee who used hypnosis to get quite a few of the
females employees to undress until nude *end* John L *end* Hulteng author of The Messenger’s Motives



Englewood Cliff NJ Prentice-Hall  p *end*  informs us "As communication researchers have
emphasized the greatest impact the media have on the formation or change of public opinion is in
terms of impressions built up over a long period." bold added The wholesomeness of Disney is an
image that has been built over a long period of time *end* Disney’s occult themes of world citizenship
witchcraft humanism and idolatry have also been long running impressions that have been craftively
perpetrated upon this nation so long that they began prior to this author’s --& probably the reader’s--
birth *end*
People don’t associate movie’s like Consenting Adults with Disney or The Corpse Had a Familiar
Face with Disney *end* In fact as previously mentioned when Disney wanted to put out more "adult"
films they did a slight of hand and created the label Touchstone films so that people wouldn’t
associate movies like Splash which showed what looked like bared breasts with Disney Productions *end* Another label Hollywood Pictures was created by Disney to help distribute Touchstone films *end* At
first the personnel of these companies was simply Disney’s staff but as time went on they got their
own production personnel *end*
On Oct *end*   Walt Disney’s Wonderful World of Color debuted on television *end* The TV show
celebrated Disney’s movie triumphs *end* The words Wonderful World of Color are not ill chosen *end* According to an Illuminati mind-control programmer when Disney worked on his cartoons and
amusement parks colors --special colors and color combinations--were specifically chosen for mind-
control programming purposes *end* Wonderful World of Color under various names such as Disneyland
aired for  years over the television networks *end* In  Walt Disney made his cartoon character
Mickey Mouse real by creating a fan club--the Mickey Mouse Club which aired five days a week
usually just as children came home from school *end* Twenty-four children called mouseketeers would
help Mickey and they would dance and sing and do skits *end* The Mickey Mouse Club adored the
unique cute little beanie Mickey Mouse caps with their big ears mounted to each side of the beanie *end* In the ’s most kid viewers of the show wanted their own "Mouse Ears" and to become a
Mouseketeer especially children who were receiving Mickey Mouse scripts in their total mind-
control programming *end* Disney used his Mouseketeers to play all the roles in an Oz movie Rainbow
Road to Oz which was never shown to the public *end* Adults today both men & women who received
Mickey Mouse programming during the ’s through ’s can still be seen with Mickey Mouse
clocks watches lampshades knick-knacks tee shirts etc *end* Years later the kids who watched can still
remember "Spin and Marty" and the Mickey Mouse theme song *end* The image that everything was
perfect including Mickey was portrayed by the Club’s T.V *end* program *end* Still somehow the American
people began to use the word "Mickey Mouse" as a synonym for a silly pretend way of doing things *end* It became common for people to say "He mickey-moused it together." to mean he did a poor job
putting it together *end* On Jan *end*   Walt Disney had a television show aired entitled "All About
Magic" where a Magic Mirror explains about magic *end* The Magic Mirror also contains a "Bibbidi-
bibbidi-Boo" sequence *end* In  Disney bought  small submarines from Todd Shipyards for
. *end*
When ABC wouldn’t let Walt make a TV series out of a storyline where a magic ring changes a boy
into a dog a mind-control programming theme--because ABC didn’t think the public could swallow
the story line--Walt quit ABC for NBC *end* Walt then made a scaled down version of this occult storyline
entitled The Shaggy Dog *end* Early in the ’s Walt and his brother Roy went secretly looking for an
area on the east coast to build another Disney Park *end* Walt the younger of the two died in  and
Roy finished the project *end* Beginning in   acres were secretly purchased at  an acre in
the Orlando FL area just west of NASA’s Cape Kennedy *end* Using phoney names and paying cash
Disney buyers bought the land and swore the sellers to secrecy *end* The Magic Kingdom has been
multiplying *end* In  Walt Disney World was opened to the public *end* Bob Hope and others participated
in a Disney special on Oct *end*   "Grand opening of Walt Disney World" *end* From the time of its
opening until Oct *end*   Disney World calculated / billion people visited DisneyWorld *end* This
amusement park is in Orlando FL on over  acres and includes the EPCOT Center now also
called simply Epcot *end* The EPCOT center was another dream of Walt Disney’s albeit more than
slightly modified from Walt’s original EPCOT ideas *end* EPCOT originally stood for Experimental



Prototype Community of Tomorrow *end* It was to be an extension of the massive mind-control being
carried out at Disney World *end* The original EPCOT city designed by Walt was to carry on its
commerce traffic via underground roads and tunnels like the Disney Theme parks *end* After Walt
Disney died his successors changed the proposed experimental city into another theme park simply
called Epcot *end* It is not unusual to see crowds of over  people descend on Walt Disney World
and the EPCOT center in a single day *end* Some visitors arrive via a monorail *end* Visitors can buy -Day

day period *end* In other words some families stay for a week at Disneyworld *end* Hardcore visitors can get

In reality many visitors to Disneyworld begin the day enthusiastic and after a day of hot sun and
waiting in long lines with large crowds for imitations of reality the tourists are zombie-like and
looking forward to getting back to their hotels *end* Many people have felt the rides were not nearly what
they expected *end* Some of the rides are better than others and some typically get comments like "It was
stupid." Some of the spooky events like Snow White’s Adventures or the oversized heads of the
Disney characters walking around can leave the little preschool children terrified and dazed for the
rest of the day *end* In contrast older children who normally rarely show patience at home may show how
much they want to go on a particular Disney ride by waiting an hour and a half in the hot sun for a
ride *end* Alien Encounter is a Walt Disneyland feature that invites tourists in for a "demonstration of
interplanetary teleportation." When the "demonstration" as planned "breaks down" an alien" with

fried deformed and then vomited into space screaming *end* Here are some comments from visitors to
this Walt Disneyland attraction

doing again *end* In fact parents who take children under the age of six should be brought up on child
abuse." Woman from MI



· "Alien Encounter was the WORST experience for my -year-old and almost every child in there *end* It starts out cute enough during the preshow but the actual show is a disaster for children *end* My
daughter screamed and cried in terror throughout it *end* I thought the Disney warnings were vague and
inaccurate *end* When we left there wasn’t one child with dry eyes even sturdy looking -year-old boys
were crying. *end* I think an age requirement of  or  is more appropriate *end* I talked to a few adults and
we even agreed that the special effects were extremely unpleasant even for us *end* This show is not a
Disney family experience--its ATROCIOUS!!" A mother from Phillipsburg NJ *end*


· "We did go to Alien Encounter...The preshow is deceiving *end* It kind of lulls you into thinking "this
isn’t so bad." When the main part came up I admit the experience gave me the absolute heebie-
jeebies *end*  *end* .I am never doing that presentation again--it was way too intense for me and I’m now
years of age!--from a family in Laurel MD Michael Eisner the President of Walt Disney Co *end* initially rejected Alien Encounter for not being scary enough when it was being considered as an
addition to Disneyworld *end* One wonders what he would have liked *end* Snow White’s Adventures which
was an attraction at Disneyland was one of what the Disney people called "dark rides" *end* After a while
a sign appeared with a witch warning people that the attraction was scary *end* Later in  they
renamed it Snow White’s Scary Adventures *end* It might be interesting to point out that when the original
Snow White and Seven Dwaffs film came out that England forbid the film to be seen by any child
under  unless accompanied by an adult because of the scary content of the movie *end* How far we have
come since then *end* Schools in the Florida and California areas also make field trips to the Magic

great deal for two mind-controlled slaves *end* They can reinforce their programming while getting
married *end* The Disney fairy-tale wedding typically has its ceremony on a pavilion on an island in the
Seven Seas Lagoon with the Cinderella Castle as a backdrop *end* The fairy-tale wedding can then be
followed with a Fantasy reception with a choice of themes such as Beauty & the Beast or Aladdin *end* The fantasy programming can continue as the bride is delivered to a "Cinderella’s Ball" by an actual
glass carriage drawn by six white Disney ponies *end* A costumed fairy-godmother & stepsisters are also
at the ball *end* Desert is served in a white chocolate slipper *end*

H *end* DISNEY & its MOB connections

When this author spoke to the co-author’s deeper Illuminati alters about Disney their reaction was
that Disney had been described to them when they were in the Illuminati as "a syndicate within a
syndicate." They said that while in the Illuminati they were aware that Disneyland had their own
government their own rules and their own police force *end* They were a crime syndicate within a
syndicate *end* What these Illuminati alters casually mentioned was verified by this author the hard way
through research *end* One Disneyland Security Supervisor said "There is no Constitution at Disneyland *end* We have our own laws." Once when Walt Disney got miffed at a Hollywood policeman Walt said
"I’ll have your badge." If Disney guards decide to they will get very rough physically with people
and assault them in any fashion they see fit *end* The people they detain are often thrown into tiny cells at
Disneyland where they are kept without benefit of a phone call without benefit of a toilet or water *end* The judicial system turns a blind eye to whatever Disney police do *end* Many people pay Disney to get
their children out of a Disney cell and never get due process of any law *end* This type of treatment has
gone on for decades and is almost a daily occurrence at Disneyland *end* The Anaheim Police force is
very chummy with the Disney private police force *end* Also at one point the Burbank Chief of Police
was the brother-in-law to Disney’s Chief of Security *end* Recently when a couple filed a wrongful death
suit against the Magic Kingdom of Disney in Florida the state of Florida surprisingly has appeared to
have backed off from their traditional behavior of protecting Disney’s sovereignty *end* An article on the
suit said ""there is evidence of some nervousness with Disney’s relative autonomy."" San Francisco
Chronicle article "Mickey’s Dark Side" Oct *end*  ‘ p *end* C An attorney in the case said "Disney
World’s security people aren’t just cops they are bad ones *end* I don’t think there is any corporation that
has ever had the perceived power that Disney has." Richard Foglesong a professor of politics at
Rollins College in Winter Park stated "Because Disney World controls so much of its corporate and
municipal universe it can’t help but act in a heavy-handed manner in order to ferociously protect its
self-interest *end* They have immunity from state and local land use law *end* They can build a nuclear plant
distribute alcohol *end* They have powers local communities don’t have *end* Do they abuse it *end* In my opinion
yes." In line with Disney’s previous dictatorial policies on their properties Disney’s new city called
Celebration will not have any elected government *end* Since the city is unincorporated a neat Disney
trick the mayor is appointed by Disney *end* Several Disney "quasi-government’" bodies control citizens
of the city *end* For instance the Celebration Residential Owners Association which participates in
binding all residents to a Declaration of Covenants a legal binder of rules that residents must live by *end* Of course the Declaration of Covenants was written by Disney *end* These rules include such nit picky
things as no more than two people can sleep in the same bedroom no pickup trucks can be parked in
front of homes and if Disney officials don’t like your cat or dog they can forcibly remove the animal
from your home *end* Disney Corp *end* has perpetrated numerous deceptions on the residents incl *end* shoddy
work on their homes and operating their ""public"" school with Disney cronies *end* Still the residents
that have moved into Celebration are glowing with praise for the town in spite of the fact that the city



is totally run by Big Brother Disney Corp *end* Of course those who don’t love it soon leave *end* So much for
the American tradition of self-government *end*

with others in a concerted manner *end* The mafia clans would then leave the annual summit meetings and
follow through in their area of operations until they would meet the next year review their successes
& failures get new assignments and decide upon new short & long term goals *end* In  the
Mishpucka worked with Mafia to highjack a bootleg shipment of whiskey travelling from Ireland to
Boston for the Kennedy Illuminati family *end* Most of Kennedy’s guards were killed in the shootout and
J.P *end* Kennedy had the widows of the guards besieging him for financial assistance *end* Billy Graham’s
good friend Mafia Chief Joseph Bonanno was one of the chiefs who attended the yearly conclaves *end* He also met with J.F *end* Kennedy in the Winter of  *end* John Kennedy was known to have said that
mobster Sam Giancana worked for his Kennedy family *end* The mob/Illuminati alliances and infighting
are too complex to deal with in this book but both groups had to put plans into action to deal with the
repeal of Prohibition which would end their lucrative bootlegging *end* The short term plan for the Mafia
was to control the film industry in Hollywood and to penetrate the unions better *end* The long term plans
called for sending their next few generations of children off to the top schools and getting them into
legitimate respectable corporate positions *end* By learning the ins and

outs of honest legal operations they could then mix in the illegal operations with their legal ones &
look legal *end* They planned to extend their power base into politics the Harvard-Stanford business
schools as well as the finest corporate board rooms *end* They intended and have succeeded in getting
some of their offspring to produce/direct T.V./films *end* They would have an increasing presence within
the Bohemian Grove membership as well as some of the other great social & business clubs *end* Their
plan to take over the film industry hinged on their union control over unions and theaters *end* The
Chicago mob controlled the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees Union *end* The mob
controlled the projectionist’s union and if the film makers had the theaters where their movies were
shown shut down what good would it be to make movies *end* The film makers and the mafia both had
power & money *end* Rather than fight a protracted war they made a deal *end* The major studios would give
about  a year to the mafia and the small ones  to be allowed to function *end* Other
agreements were also reached *end* Mob henchmen Willie Bioff and George E *end* Browne were mob
lieutenants who orchestrated the mob’s "Hollywood takeover" *end*
Time Magazine Nov *end*   wrote "In the witness chair in Manhattan’s Federal Court sat bland
wily Willie Bioft pronounced Buy-off blackmailer panderer labor leader and now star witness
against eight ex-pals who are charged with shaking down  million from the movie
industry...Question Was it true that Bioft once had a five-year plan for taking over % of
Hollywood’s profits-and eventually % interest In the studios themselves *end* Bioff wistfully "If
we’d lasted that long we would have *end* Question "Did you ever say you were boss of Hollywood and



could make producers do whatever you wanted?" Bioff "Yes-and I could make them dance to my
tune." Although Bioff rolled over on his pals and ended up getting car bombed that didn’t stop the
mob/Mishpucka infiltration & control of Hollywood *end* Bioff had tried to save his public image by
helping Walt Disney settle his labor dispute with the mob-led unions but Walt wisely relected his
offer of help and made sure he didn’t offend the Chicago mob leaders who were disgruntled with
Bioff *end* Hundreds of millions of dollars were poured by the Mafia & Mishpucka into real estate in
southern California by using legitimate local businessmen to launder the money *end* Hollywood was
declared a "free zone" where all the Mafia/Mishpucka families could operate without a fear of a turf
war *end* Let us backtrack slightly to  *end* Columbia distributed Disney cartoons from  until
when Disney switched to United Artists because Columbia wasn’t bothering to pay Disney the
money they owed *end* In  Cohn Pres *end* of Columbia Pictures got Disney off the financial hook with
Powers by intimidating Powers with some street toughs carrying a legal suit *end* If Disney wasn’t
indebted to the mafia before he was at that point *end* Biographers have been puzzled why Disney went
into such a traumatic depression after Henry Cohn "helped" him *end* Tough guy Henry Cohn made sure
Walt knew who was boss *end* His attitude was that Walt should be happy to be paid at all by him for the
cartoons Walt supplied Columbia *end* After this Walt would lock himself in his room and weep
uncontrollably for hours *end* He was impossible for anyone to get along with *end* He was unable to focus on
anything and would stare for long periods out the window *end* Biographers blame Walt’s behavior on the
fact that his wife was pregnant *end* They also blame it on his friend Iwerks defection to another company *end* Frankly Walt had treated Iwerk like a dog and deep down must have known why Iwerk left such an
abusive relationship *end* To claim that he wept for hours day after day because he realized he might
become a father is too much to swallow *end* When Walt was asked years later about why he was so
depressed he said it was the stress of the financial situation *end* Walt said I had a nervous breakdown *end* ..Costs were going up; each new picture we finished cost more to make than we had figured it would
earn when we first began to plan it...I cracked up." This author submits to the reader that part of his
breakdown may have indeed been the financial stress from having come under the heel of the mafia *end* They had all the means to make or break him and he had no choice but to surrender to their
overwhelming power to blackmail & destroy him OR to get out of the business *end* What this did was
place Walt in a position where his two strongest traits had to clash--his overwhelming obsession to be
his own boss and his creative obsession to create animation which was wrapped up with his ego &
his deep phobias and psychological needs *end* His mind couldn’t give up its independence nor its
creativity without great mental anguish and therefore Walt was very saddened knowing that he
would have to admit defeat and buckle under the heels of the big boys *end* Just when he needed
emotional support his wife was going to have a child and his best animator left *end* Walt had abandoned
Iwerks years before and Walt’s wife had wanted a child for some time *end* Iwerk’s departure and his
arriving child do not in themselves account for the long intense nervous breakdown that Walt
experienced *end* Biographers point out that Walt was very reluctant to have children and that he was
impotent with women including his wife much of the time *end* His impotency to carry out normal sex
may help explain his secret sexual habits *end* Walt’s masonic brother Carl Laemmle offered Walt a good
deal to help him recover from Henry Cohn’s abusive control of Walt but Carl wanted the copyright
to Mickey Mouse in return for the help and Walt wouldn’t part with Mickey Mouse *end* Instead Walt
signed a contract offered by Joseph Schenck of UA United Artists who was one of the Mafia’s
illegal drug kingpins *end* In  the mob’s illegal drug dealer Joseph Schenck went on to found
Century Inc *end* which later merged with Fox in ‘ to form Twentieth Century-Fox whose board of
directors would include two Illuminati kingpins William Randolph Hearst and Malcolm MacIntyre *end* Joseph Schenck’s brother Nicholas Schenck and Marcus Loew merged Metro Pictures and Goldwyn
Pictures and named Louis B *end* Mayer as its head *end* Meanwhile over the years MCA headed up by
Illuminati Kingpin Lew Wasserman gained a monopoly over the American film industry with the
secret backroom deals that they made with Ronald Reagan’s Screen Actor’s Guild and Petrillo’s
American Fed of Musicians *end* By the way Lew Wasserman would try to revive Reagan’s acting
career in the early ‘’s *end* Frank Sinatra and Walt Disney were both friends of Ronald Reagan and all
three believed in mind-control *end* Ronald Reagan and Petrillo in turn worked with the Mafia’s NCS
Council of  which incl *end* Anthony Accardo and Sam Giancana which at one point divided the U.S *end* into  mob territories *end* After J *end* Schenck went to jail very briefly he was replaced as Pres *end* of -
Cent *end* Fox by Spyros Skouras *end* Before his arrest while Schenck was still in charge of -Cent *end* Fox



he made numerous offers to Disney for Disney to incorporate his studio as a subdivision of -
Cent *end* Fox *end* Disney worked for a few years with them distributing his films but he would not let go of
trying to be independent *end* The FBI and American Intelligence turned to the mob to help them as the
U.S *end* entered WW II *end* Perhaps Walt’s mob connection added impetus for his recruitment *end* Walt went to
a number of American Nazi meetings prior to Pearl Harbor *end* This author believes from knowing
Walt’s personality that Walt may have been on assignment rather than a Nazi sympathizer *end* Still why
does one of Disney’s pre-Pearl harbor cartoons display a swastika *end* Disney’s Epcot Resorts is close to
the mob’s Atlantic City Board Walk with its nightclubs *end* The resort was designed by Robert A.M *end* Stern *end* This author doesn’t know about Robert Stern but there are programmed multiples and
Illuminati members within the Stern family *end* At Walt Disney World the nightclub there was named
"Cage" and then later ’ TRAX" *end* Comedy Warehouse which is a nightclub at Pleasure Island in
Walt Disney World opened on May   and has used slave comedians as well having people who
are mind-control abusers *end* On Feb *end*   Walt Disney Co *end* was reincorporated in Delaware *end* Delaware is the only state that allows total corporate secrecy *end* No one can find out who really is
running a Delaware corporation and many other secrets can be hidden under Delaware’s corporation
laws *end* Capital Group has considerable shares in Disney as well as % of the shares of the Robert
Mondavi winery at  St *end* Helena Hwy Oakville CA *end* Wellington Group and Mellon bank also
have shares *end* Behind Capital Group are mob controlled groups like Debartolo Reality Corp *end* and La
Quinta Inns a Bass bro *end* operation *end* Sam Bronfman operates Sterling & Monterey Vineyards *end* There
are countless people walking around that have felt the ruthless impersonal controlling money-
grabbing side of the Disney Corp *end* Also there are a number of journalists who have experienced first
hand the secrecy and paranoia that the Disney corporation has *end* Most journalists are not used to the
secrecy that pervades Disney *end* Because Disney has shaped the myths of America for several
generations the public takes more concern over who is running Disney than they would other
institutions *end* Because most of America believe in the image that the Illuminati have built for Disney
they are rooting for it to succeed *end*


How the Disney Executives have figured out how to steal land all across the U.S *end*
Over the years Walt Disney has developed several very sneaky reliable techniques to acquire land *end* They acquire land through their executives and large stockholders and family members of the execs
and stockholders *end* After all the deals are made in an area and when everything is in place over a
period of time these people then turn their land over to Disney *end* Disney works with government
officials and local bankers to line up special deals so they can succeed in their plans *end* After everything
is lined up the corporation announces their plans and goes forward *end* This methodology has been used
repeatedly for instance the American History Theme Park in the Manassas Civil War battlefield area
of Virginia for which Disney has acquired  acres and has access to at least  more *end* In Nov *end* ‘ after a new Virginia governor was elected the Virginia "Disney’s America" project was
announced and Virginia voted almost instantly for the money for transportation and infrastructure
improvements to the area so that Disney’s theme park would be viable *end* Disney set up  banks in
Napa CA *end* Their banks made loans to old families in the valley *end* The trusts and the wills for these
families were made up by Stanford Univ *end* grads *end* These people set on the boards of these banks or
connect with the boards of these banks *end* They charge large fees and know every trick in the book to
rob people of their estates and their living trusts *end* The Stanford grads who connect in with intelligence
agencies & the mob use certain code words when they set up their businesses such as RESOURCE
EVERGREEN and PACIFIC *end* There are a number of scared landholders who are being intimidated to
sell their land in the Napa Valley region *end*


DISNEY and the GOVERNMENT

Just prior to W.W *end* II the FBI recruited Walt Disney *end* His job was to spy on Hollywood or anything
else that looked suspicious *end* Documents obtained from the Freedom of Information Act in spite of



heavy censoring clearly show that Walt Disney became a paid Special Correspondent asset of the
FBI *end* He reported to FBI agent E.E *end* Conroy *end* In  Walt was promoted to Special Agent in Charge
SAC which means others reported to him *end* After "leaving" the CIA ex-DCI ex-head of the CIA
William Hedgcock Webster became a lawyer for the Wash *end* D.C *end* based firm of Milbank Tweed
Hadley and McCloy *end* In  when news broke about Walt Disney’s FBI membership ex-CIA head
Webster worked with the Disney family to cover up to the public that Walt Disney was an FBI agent *end* Webster went on TV and had interviews to spread the fabrication that Walt was not connected to the
FBI *end* Why *end* One of the countless items that Disney was involved in was the investigation into the
disappearance/rape of a six-year old child Rose Marie Riddle on // *end* According to documents
gotten from the Freedom of Information Act W.G *end* Simon was the FBI agent who met with SAC
Walt Disney in L.A *end* about the case *end* W.G *end* Simon has been one of those people who has been publicly
lying by claiming that Walt Disney never was an FBI agent *end* The paper trail proves otherwise *end* Why is
it so important to the FBI and CIA to cover up that Walt was an FBI agent *end* Walt also worked for the
CIA even though documentation of that is not available *end* This author theorizes that the reason the FBI
and CIA are so touchy about letting people know that Walt worked for the government is that the
Network knows how the FBI and CIA worked together to procure children for mind-control
programming purposes *end* Because Disney and Disneyland played such as enormous role in Mind-
control Disney’s connection to them although on the sufface a seemingly minor fact is in reality a
minor fact setting on top of an enormous ghastly secret *end* When W.W *end* II started the government
incorporated the Disney studios into the war machine *end* The military paid Disney  for
training cartoon which cost Disney  to make *end* Disney studios also made some secret films for
the military *end* Mickey Mouse and Goofy cartoons were slanted to have war themes for instance the
Goofy cartoon of  "The Art of Self Defense" and "How to be a Sailor" in  *end* Perhaps in honor
of the contribution Disney had made to the war effort "Mickey Mouse" was the password of the
Allies for millions of men on the big D-Day invasion on June  *end* Walt Disney produced a
cartoon showing Donald Duck paying his taxes faithfully *end* The film was entitled The New Spirit *end* It
was very successful in getting Americans to comply with the IRS *end* In  Disney made a film for
the public schools for sex education entitled The Story of Menstruation *end* For the United Nations Walt
Disney created "It’s a Small World" attraction for UNICEF for the ‘- World’s Fair *end* This
attraction was moved to the theme parks & has been a major feature for mind-control *end* After learning
of the enormous amount of mind-control programming going on during after hours in secret tunnels at
Disney as well as in the public facilities it makes more sense why the Russian Premier Nikita
Khrushchev would be denied a visit to Disneyland by the U.S *end* government "due to security
considerations" when he was visiting the U.S *end* in Sept *end*  *end* Khrushchev obviously had his own
security working in tandem with American security and the intelligence people for whatever reasons
didn’t want the complication of these Russians going to a major programming site *end* Some powerful
military men have been connected to Disney films *end* Two former commanding officers of the USS
Alabama nuclear sub were technical advisors for the Disney film Crimson Tide *end* Walt Disney was tied
to the U.S *end* government and recent disclosures show that he was tied to the FBI *end* Walt used his FBI
connection to destroy the life of Art Babbitt who had led the strike against Disney in  *end* Babbitt
found that everything he attempted in life after the strike was ruined by some hidden power *end* Was
Walt part of naval intelligence attached to the FBI *end* Was he part of the FBI that is involved with child
procurement and mind-control *end* In the ’s the Illuminati began organizing covens on the West
coast and began solidifying their power *end* This comes from several independent sources *end* Likewise
it’s clear that Disney didn’t have the clout in  with local governments that it does today *end* Walt
Disney was unsuccessful when he tried to get permission from the city of Los Angeles and the
Burbank City Council for the construction of Disneyland called Disneylandia at that time in the
Burbank area *end* One Burbank councilman told Walt "We don’t want the carny atmosphere in
Burbank."" Inconsistently within a few years they gave permission to Universal to build an
amusement park in Burbank which opened in  *end* Disney then ask the Stanford Research Institute
to locate a spot for Disneylandia Disneyland which they found at Anaheim *end* In recent years Disney
decided they wanted to build another amusement park called California Adventure across from
Disneyland *end* In order to do so the Interstate highway will have to have changes and the Anaheim city
council needed to approve the large  acre expansion *end* In contrast to the Burbank City Council in
 Anaheim’s City Council was enthusiastic about the expansion in spite of lots of local



opposition *end* The locals complained at council meetings to the City Council that the city had no
business going hundreds of millions of dollars into debt to help a corporate giant *end* Anaheim will issue
 million in bonds *end* Locals also raised concerns that the public school system in Anaheim is
stressed to the breaking point where they are considering going to half days and that Disney
Corporation should give as much consideration for the school children of Anaheim as they do to their
Amusement park *end* Disneyland’s Pres *end* Paul Pressler bragged about Disney’s new California Adventure
amusement park "Disney’s California Adventure is really a

celebration of the fun the beauty the people and the accomplishments of this magical state *end* We really
have set out to try to capture a bit of what the California dream is all about." Sounds like the dream is
to be wealthy and control people *end* The elite would rather give us BREAD & CIRCUS than an
education *end*
The Dragnet films were done in part at the Disney studios *end* In an Office Memo from the -new LA
SAC FBI agent to Hoover // which was obtained via the Freedom of Information Act the
typed memo states Mr *end* Disney has volunteered representatives of this office complete access to the
facilities of Disneyland for use in connection with official matters..." Historically we now know that
Disney’s use for "official matters" included mind-control *end*


J *end* DISNEY & MIND CONTROL

Once the reader is familiar with the programming scripts the reader merely needs to watch the
Disney "Adventures in Wonderland" that come on TV in the morning to see Disney mind-control at
work *end* Within a few minutes one morning this author had seen a white rabbit create "a world in your
mind" the quote is what the show said *end* with a ring watched Alice go through the mirrors watched a
White Rabbit the programmer read a book to a little girl and the TV listener be told by the show
"The White Rabbit is our only hope!" The deeper alters of Illuminati slaves who are programmed for

Florida capital to request quid pro quo and the governor gave it to Disney *end* What that meant is that
Disney’s property in Florida was totally controlled under Disney’s jurisdiction they had their own
laws their own police force their own hospitals and their own tax rate *end* No outside authority would
interfere with Disney’s jurisdiction *end* DisneyWorld’s finances would be untouchable and out of sight

saw the kidnapper carrying the child out of the park with the boy slumped over his shoulder *end* In that
short of a time the kidnapper had drugged the child cut his hair different and put a different shirt on
him *end* This anecdote was mention in Inside the Mouse pg *end*  As written before white slavery is part
of what Disney is all about *end* This mother was one of the fortunate few who did manage to find their
kidnapped children *end* An insider states that the Disney police are definitely part of those moving and
abusing innocent children brought in for occult rituals *end* In addition the Disney security forces spy on
their own employees *end* Employees do not enter the theme parks like the visitors nor do they move
around like the visitors *end* They have underground tunnels and underground entrances and facilities for
that *end* One victim of total mind-control mentioned that a tunnel entrance was at the Matterhorn
mountain at Disneyland *end* The Matterhorn was opened by Walt and his good-friend Richard Nixon
who rode in the first car down the mountain *end* The Disney productions has given the Illuminati the
cover to bring together Illusionists magicians and special effects artists without anyone being
suspicious *end* Some of these men were able to apply their talents toward programming children *end* As an
example of their talents Disney special effects artists were able to create  realistic-looking cadavers
for the  film Gross Anatomy *end* Walt Disney Inc *end* has teamed up with Los Alamos and Sandia
Labs two other groups which are heavily involved in mind-control and people control to develop
body scans branding and access codes for the visitors to Disney’s theme parks *end* Each of the Disney
Theme parks such as Disneyland DisneyWorld EuroDisney etc *end* have vast underground facilities *end* These underground facilities allow many of the workers to get to the ride areas via underground

relationship between Disney Mind-control and the charismatic movement and its use of trauma-based
total mind-control *end*


DISNEYANA FOR THE PROGRAMMED & OBSESSED *end*
For people who have been programmed with Disney programming and who are obsessed with
Mickey Mouse and everything else about Disney and for other people who just have the collecting
spirit for Disney memorabilia there is a group called Disneyana *end* Disneyana was organized in the
’s and consists of people who are cult-like in their devotion to anything true Disney *end* Some of
them to express their devotion outwardly tatoo their bodies with Disney characters *end* This group holds
their annual convention at the Contemporary Resort in FL *end* One Disneyana at the annual convention
said "We collect to keep the good feeling inside." Another when interviewed said "This is why it’s
all about love." The author knows as a fact some of the men who are obsessed with Mickey Mouse &
Disney items are programmed multiples *end* One of Kenneth Anger’s occult friends has had the world’s
largest Mickey Mouse collection *end* Who is Kenneth Anger *end* Kenneth Anger a member of LaVey’s
Magick Circle & later his Church of Satan is an occultist and an underground film maker *end* Kenneth
Anger he choose the last name Anger was raised on the Wizard of Oz books *end* His biographer Bill
Landis writes that the Oz books "laid the groundwork for Ken’s attraction to Crowley the occultist
who would rework Rosicrucian thought into his own magical system." Ken was obsessed with
Crowley’s life & magic *end* As a child Ken had danced with Shirley Temple in competition after she
became a child star *end* Ken Anger loved the OTO’s solar phallic religion and was also obsessed with
Mickey Mouse *end* He spent part of his time studying his friend’s Mickey Mouse collection *end* Ken Anger
did his casting for his film Lucifer Rising" by telling occult friends & acquaintances that they could
live out their goddess or god power-trip fantasies by acting for him *end* The British government’s
National Film Finance Corp *end* fronted £ for Lucifer Rising’s production *end* Famous occult
musician Jimmy Page did the sound track gratis *end* Ken Anger acted as the film’s Magus and made his
Magus role resemble Mickey Mouse in the film Fantasia *end* The role Fantasia plays in mind-control



programming will follow as the last part of this chapter *end* "Lucifer Rising" also starts with Fantasia-
type volcanoes *end* Another of his well-known films was "Invocation of My Demon Brother."



Mind-control features in Disney movies *end*
The elements within Disney movies that are intentionally put in for mind-control would take volumes
to describe *end* A detailed description of how just one Disney movie is used as a programming script
soon follows *end* Fantasia was selected as the example *end* A random sampling of features in Disney movies
for mind-control programming could include

· Cogworth the enchanted mantle clock in Beauty and the Beast *end*
· The character Door Knob which is a doorknob portrayed as a person in the Disney cartoon Alice In
Wonderland is useful for programming door knob alters *end*
· The Blue Yonder is a Disney movie on time travel of a young boy *end* Time travel movies are used for
programming to mess up the victim’s sense of time *end*
· Disney film "Animated Alphabet" has letters which come alive which is useful for programming *end* And what about the ‘ Disney movie "Computers are People Too!"  *end*
· All the Illuminati members this author is aware of who have received trauma-based total mind-
control were taught to astrally project and study on the astral plane what they needed to learn *end* A
Disney movie that portrays this is Goofy over Dental Health *end* This is an educational film released by
Disney in ‘ and again in ‘ where Goofy places a magical toothbrush under a child’s pillow so
that the child astrally projects to a dentist office and while on the astral plane studies how to have
healthy teeth *end*
· Illuminati alters believe that trees and flowers are alive *end* The  Disney film Flowers and Trees is
a story about two trees who fall in love *end* The film portrays the occult belief that trees can talk and
sing *end* Internally alter systems will be constructed with singing trees and flowers that represent people
and which are alters *end* The singing trees give out internal codes to move alters internally where they
need to go *end* Return to Oz *end*  This Disney film begins its story line about a girl who is thought to
have psychological problems because of her tales of Oz *end* She is warned not to talk about Oz by her
relatives *end* She is taken to a psychologist who wears a big ruby ring who tells Dorothy that
electroshocks won’t hurt her and that we are at the "dawn of a New Age." Dorothy is told that her
memories are just dreams" that stem from excess electrical current in the brain *end* She is sent to a
mental institution to receive shock treatments for talking about Oz *end* A lightening storm allows her to
escape the shock treatments and when she sleeps she awakes in Oz *end* In Oz she goes through many
mind-control scenarios ruby slippers mirrors etc *end* and toward the end visits with evil Mombi
Princess of Oz who keeps Ozma Dorothy’s twin as a slave *end* Mombi eventually casts a spell and
enchants Ozma into a mirror *end* Sci-Fi author J.D *end* Vinge in her Return to Oz based on the screen play
writes on pg *end* - "Dorothy gazed at herself in the mirror seeing her own reflection and
remembering the moment when she had looked at herself and seen someone else there someone so
like her that it could have been her sister." Parts of this film were filmed near Stonehenge Eng *end* Disney has put out several films on the Wizard of Oz theme all of which were used for programming *end* The original series of Oz books were by Baum *end* In ’ MGM did the famous Wizard of Oz film *end* In
the Disney movie Tron  a young computer genius goes into an altered state where he ends up
becoming a computer program *end* After defeating the MCP he returns to the real world *end* This is simply a
programming script *end* A special effects team created a -D world showing how talented Disney special
effects people can be in making something seem real *end* This movie should show people their mind-
control capabilities *end* Mathematical Applications Group Inc *end* MAGI were one of the groups that
created the graphics *end* Disney came out with  videos of new adventures in Wonderland which are
mind-control programming *end* In the mornings here - on channel  Disney has a Wonderland
Show every morning which is mind-control programming for children *end* Within a few minutes this



author had seen a girl walk through a mirror the  lives of Thomasina mentioned and a little ditty
"I’m a little tea-pot" where a person becomes a tea pot *end* They also had an "under the umbella" scene *end* This was all pure programming right on TV *end* Of course they show the White Rabbit as a central
figure *end* ABC under the auspices of Disney produced a lengthy  min *end* film Wild Palms which
depicts Illuminati mind-control and life *end* One reader of Vol *end*  stated that the Wild Palms movie would
have made no sense except that having read the Vol *end*  book the movie made lots of sense in the light
of Vol *end* ’s revelations *end* The film depicts how children are kidnapped switched at birth programmed
via TV cartoons programmed to kill and use stun guns etc *end* The film depicts Illuminati bloodlines and
arranged marriages *end* Although the name Illuminati" is not used if viewers substitute in the name "the
Fathers" for Illuminati fathers they will get an insider’s view of life at the top *end* The main controllers
are addressed by their slaves as "Papa" or "Daddy" or "Mother" *end* This is true to life *end* A person opposed
to the Fathers states "One day we will wake up and discover we don’t own this country and no one
will care." The movie states that events are not happening randomly *end* The movie shows an
underground tunnel system which has an entrance hidden by a swimming pool *end* Quite a few actual
programming codes were said during the film for instance "down down down through the pool of
tears..." and "we’re going to go down the yellow brick road now." The movie was created by Bruce
Wagner who obviously is an insider concerning trauma-based total mind-control *end* The fact the movie
was made shows the arrogance of the programmers’ beliefs that their criminal acts in programming
thousands of little children will not be exposed and that people will be too stupid to realize that what
is put out as fiction is actually mirroring what is happening *end* It’s like they believe their own script that
IF people did find out "no one will care."

Because so much of the Illuminati programming involves the creation and programming of  alters
linked into trinities it is not surprising that Disney has helped such triad programming with a series of
movies about threesomes including

 Blind Mouseketeers

Three Caballeros

 little pigs

Three Little Wolves

 Lives of Thomasina

The Three Musketeers

 Ninjas

Three Orphan Kittens

For Mickey Mouse programming they came out with Thru the Mirror where Mickey Mouse steps
through his bedroom mirror and ends up in another world altered state *end* Not all of the Disney movies
that have mind-control programming themes got released to the public *end* One unreleased cartoon had
Penelope fleeing from a sinister looking Grandfather Clock which is carrying her to another world
and has another scene where Penelope tries to hold onto someone who personifies the Wind *end* George
Lucas who directed the movie Star Wars which was a movie planned by the Illuminati & used for
Illuminati programming also directed Disney’s movie "Captain EO" *end* Captain EO who looks like a
demonic entity goes to rescue the Queen who looks like the harlot describes as Mystery Babylon in
the Bible *end* The Queen is in captivity simply because she and her people believe in black and white
which represent good and evil *end* When they renounce such a belief they are saved by Michael
Jackson in actual life a mind-controlled slave playing Captain EO *end* It’s a New Age witchcraft film
through & through *end* By the way Michael Jackson has gone to Disney amusement parks many times
sometimes in disguise *end* It is public knowledge that his Jehovah’s Witness family has been very
abusive mentally and physically to their children *end* Disney has put out several movies on how the mind
works such as the educational film The Brain & Nervous System in  *end* Their film Runaway Brain



is a cartoon where Dr *end* Frankenollie transplants Mickey’s brain into a monster’s body & vice-versa *end* A
 film Puppet Masters shows the govt.’s secret Office of Scientific Intelligence trying to save the
U.S *end* from aliens who live in human bodies *end* In recent years Bette Midler has been Disney’s main
actress *end* In the Vol *end*  it was exposed that she is possibly a Monarch Mind-controlled slave *end* She is
famous for her "mood swings" switches in personality and she had a "mental breakdown" in  *end* Her eyes and body gestures are those of a programmed multiple *end* She has gone out on tour for Disney
without making -money and she is best of friends with Jeffrey Katzenberg second in command at
Disney *end* Jeffrey Katzenberg by the way is extremely disliked by his counterpart Sid Sheinberg *end* Bette
Midler plays Stella in the movie Stella *end* Stella is an occult name *end* In the movie the script seems
tailored for Bette Midler and for someone who is a programmed slave rather than the actress fitting
the role *end* At the movie’s end Stella Bette Midler attends her own daughter’s marriage by peeking in
a window and watching from the outside *end* This is the script they give so many of the parts of a slave
so that they feel unworthy and feel like they are always on the outside looking in at life *end* Many parts
personalities of slaves find it hard to connect with real life because they feel they are on the outside
looking in *end* And then in true Disney fashion Disney had Bette Midler play the role of the lead witch
in Hocus Pocus *end* The movie Hocus Pocus does some hocus pocus of its own *end* While pretending to
make fun of witchcraft they actually teach witchcraft *end* They do make the  witches look comical *end* By
the way the  witches stand for the maiden mother crone combo that the Illuminati reverence *end* Disney subtly works in deep occult things such as the all-seeing eye on the cover of the book the
little girl promising the cat who is a familiar spirit that her descendants would always care for it
true because the cat was a generational spirit *end* The cat is killed in the movie but can’t die *end* And Bette
Midler as lead witch in her costume which has some Mother-of-Darkness symbology on it states as
she gets ready to take the life force from an innocent girl "We want to live forever so we take
children’s lives." This is wholesome entertainment for children *end* The Disney capacity for deception
extends to its own workers *end* PR men recruit young people for its Disney College program *end* They tell
the young people what a great stepping stone it will be for their careers *end* They have been known to
make it sound like the greatest thing in your life *end* Kids come from all over the country due to the slick
recruiting tactics to work for Disney *end* They are then housed in Disney housing given menial jobs and
paid low wages *end* Most people in the College Program leave disillusioned *end* If the worker happens to
think of a great idea Disney officials have been known to steal the idea and because the worker was
working for Disney the worker will find that they are unable to get any credit or money for the idea
that Disney steals and makes millions off of *end* One uncredited creator of a Disney sale item said
iterally they’re using everybody for everything." Inside the Mouse p *end*  *end*
 >>> Next will be the script for how the Disney film Fantasia has been used as a standard
programming tool since the ’s by the Illuminati *end*


DETAILED SCRIPT ON HOW THE DISNEY FILM FANTASIA IS USED FOR
PROGRAMMING TRAUMA-BASED MIND-CONTROLLED SLAVES *end*
During the ’s ‘’s and ‘’s at least % of the Illuminati’s trauma-based mind-controlled
slaves were subjected to watching Disney’s Fantasia film in order for them to build the foundational
imagery of the mind-control *end* Child mind-control victims had their eyes taped open and then sat one-
on-one with their primary programmers so that the programmers could give the scripts as the child
watched Disney’s Fantasia over and over *end* What made Fantasia unique as a programming tool is that it
had almost everything the programmers needed to create the foundational imagery for their trauma-
based mind-control *end* To build a dependable alter system means that the worlds need a solid
foundation *end* Fantasia has provided the means to get a solid foundation for the internal worlds that the
Illuminati slaves build in their mind *end* It is also a masterpiece in coordinating color and music *end*
The Disney film Fantasia which premiered on Nov *end*   at Broadway Theater in NYC was a
financial disaster as a movie but was an Illuminati programming masterpiece *end* The film was released
to theaters in ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ in order to catch every generation of children *end* The video was released in  *end* During programming much of the child slave’s mind will watch the



film *end* One particular part alter will be forced to memorize everything in the film *end* This small part
small alter is well hidden in each victim’s mind *end* This small alter who has a vivid and total recall of
the film Fantasia is locked carefully away so that ONLY an access code will pull him/her up *end* Watching the videotape Fantasia is not going to pull this alter up *end* The programmers pull this alter up
when they have a clean slate alter *end* When they are taking a clean slate of the mind they will pull the
clean part up and have the alter who has memorized Fantasia throw its memory onto an internal big
screen *end* The internal Outer space aka Rubicon is shaped like an amphitheater and functions as a big
vast screen for replay *end* There is an internal ball or sun created via the lighting effect of the movie
Fantasia so that the movie appears projected in the mind as on a globe *end* And the Fantasia film images
hit this internal globe and go circular in the mind and spin through the system *end* The programmer will
then say to the new part "THIS IS WHAT I WANT YOU TO CREATE *end* THIS IS WHAT WE
NEED." In this fashion Fantasia has provided the programmers with their primary tool for taking a
dissociated clean slate part of the mind and manipulating it to become a new workable part within the
system *end* The young part that holds the entire Fantasia memory is strategically placed in the system so
that it can be called up from anyplace in the system *end* No matter where the programmer is working in
the system he can access this small alter whose function is to remember the movie *end* Most of the
system will go into a trance sleep if shown the movie *end* The front as well as most of the system’s
alters will be totally amnesic to having ever seen the movie *end* Since the programming put in with
Fantasia is so fundamental it should come as no surprise that the programmers have done an excellent
job in protecting this programming from everyone including the slave *end* Abreacting the film for many
alters could rip the system apart because after the film is memorized severe trauma begins to be
overlaid and attached to the film *end* There may be some small alters that still carry tiny bits and pieces
of memory of the movie but only one will really remember it *end*
The following script will be a running account of how Fantasia has been used as an important
preparatory film for Illuminati trauma-based mind-control to train the mind-control victim’s mind to
be able to visualize the programming that will be layered in *end* The time clock will begin when the
feature film’s action begins and then will run its entire  minutes *end* This will give the researcher of
mind-control a blow-by-blow description of how a Disney movie is used for programming *end* The film
was often shown to child victims around  to  years of age with a wide screen while the child was
under a guided LSD trip *end* Prior to the use of LSD some other drugs were used *end* A Grande Dame or
Mother-of-Darkness often worked with the Illuminati programmer as an Assistant Programmer *end* The
scripts & the programming have already been discussed prior to showing the child the film so the
programmers know the direction they want to take the child & will tailor some of what is said to the
child victim to individualize the programming *end* When a three or four year old is shown Fantasia on a
hypnotically-prepared and controlled LSD trip the colors & effects of Fantasia are increased about
 times *end* The film is realer than real to the child *end* The movie will not be shown just once but over
and over so that the scripts are ingrained into the mind *end* The imagery for the child’s internal world will
be well established because the big screen movie enhanced by both the drugs and the bright colors of
the art work will seem more real that life itself *end* At this time the child is a multiple but the walls
between the various parts of the mind are not solid but similar to the walls between ego states in an
adult non-multiple *end* A large part of the  or  year-old child’s system will be allowed to view the
system including the Christian parts *end* Then the entire system with the single exception of the alter
carrying the entire memory of the film will be hypnotically told to forget having seen the film *end* Years
later the front alters will not remember having seen the movie but they may have a strange dislike
for the film *end* They may find that they can’t identify where their feelings of dislike of the film stem
from *end* The child victim will watch the movie with its programmer and assistant programmer one-on-
one with no other children in the room *end* The child will watch the film repeatedly and be grilled about
what is in the movie *end* The child will see the movie so many times in such a vivid form and will be
tested to the point that the movie will be memorized *end* But it will be hypnotically locked up in the
subconscious by the programmers so that it forms a base for the mind to begin building
programming but will remain hidden from the conscious *end* At the time the Fantasia film was made the
Illuminati had been creating trained multiples for years but they knew they wanted to program the
different personalities in accordance with the best mind-control techniques of the day *end* For this reason
the Fantasia film was planned ahead of time so that it could possibly serve as a programming aid *end*


The film is silent almost no words except for music so that it can be used for hypnotic visualization
so that the Mother of Darkness & the programmer can fill in the programming script with the child
victim as they watch the movie *end* As it turned out their plans were successful *end* The New Age author
David Tame states in his book The Secret Power of Music Rochester VT Destiny Books  p *end*  that Fantasia is *end*  *end*  *end* "A superb marriage between the visual and musical arts *end* Most of the
sequences. *end* .are what New Age cinema was intended to be!" The power of the movie to influence the
mind stands out *end* In order to make the film Disney used some strong arm tactics on a few people *end* The
movie was a box office flop when first released in the ’s but then it was made for the occult
world anyway *end* By the ’s the Illuminati had create a drug culture and had lots of undetectable
mind-controlled slaves running around that had been programmed with Fantasia *end* In the ’s
Fantasia became a hit with the drug culture which had its share of Illuminati slaves deeply involved in
it *end* One more reminder the sentences that are "ALL CAPS" in the script are things that the
programmers are saying to the child victim as the child watches the film *end* Bear in mind that the child
watches the film over & over so not everything indicated in this script by caps that the programmer
says will necessarily be said in one showing *end*
 minutes *end* Curtains open *end* Action begins with an orchestra *end* The Conductor upon a step pyramid is
the center of the scene and is shown to be the center of authority *end* Master Programmer Dr *end* Joseph
Mengele liked Fantasia because he was a musician and a violinist *end* Mengele Dr *end* Green liked Bach
Beethoven and Schubert and orchestra music *end* He enjoyed taking what he liked & using this music to
make slaves *end* He would portray himself during programming as being the conductor & all the
orchestra were his children *end* The film will allow for a repetition of this theme *end*


 *end* minutes *end* The instruments begin playing *end* The musicians are silhouettes which cast shadows upon
the wall *end* Alters will often see themselves in this fashion too as merely a shadow or merely a
silhouette *end*

the film may suggest to your imagination "geometric figures floating in space."

stories some to create definite pictures and some music exists for its own sake *end*

 *end* minutes *end* He states that Abstract images that might pass through your mind...music will suggest
other things to your imagination..." The Philadelphia Orchestra begins playing "Toccata and Fuge" by
Bach in the background *end* As a cartoon for children or adults the film has already lost the normal
audience at this point *end* There is no way that Disney could have escaped realizing that the film starts
out losing the normal audience *end*
 *end* minutes *end* The conductor is standing out and everyone else is a silhouette with shadow mirror
images like so many of the alters become *end* Leopald Stokowski is now standing as the rising sun
rises *end* This is an allusion to sun worship and the sun rising in the east *end* The music is going up and
down and this music at this point is used to train the child to go up and down the trance ladder that
is to go deeper or lighter in trance *end*
 *end* minutes *end* The conductor opens his hands and waves them in an Illuminati hand signal *end* The music
begins *end*
 minutes *end* A row of violinists play they are merely silhouettes with shadows *end*
 *end* minutes *end* A harp scale is played in the background that is used in the programming *end* Triggers are
attached to this harp scale or the harp scale is used as a foundation identifier for a piano scale *end* More
children can be taught the piano than the harp so this scale is usually transferred to a piano scale *end*

When the core is being first split the parts of the mind that are creative are taken and used to create
the fairies *end* The programmers will only take these original creative splits they will not try to get
fairies from any more torture *end* The fairies are the creative parts of the child how ever many creative



parts that the child has splintered will be the number of fairies created *end* These parts of the mind
receive very heavy programming *end* They are core splits *end* If readers remember on page  of Vol *end*  it
refers to a Core Protector coded "Creation" *end* That alter was a fairy a core split *end* Not only does this
creative part make things "magically" for the system it protects the core *end* Does that help people to
understand how the Core can be so creatively protected? *end* For more understanding about the Core see
Cisco’s very deep article on the Core *end* Fairies are assigned to every part of an alter system *end* The child
of  or  who watches Fantasia has had their core locked away at  / *end* The core’s stars have not
been locked away yet & have access to her energy *end* When the system is built the stars are locked
away & become the core’s guardians *end* They will act like the core to protect her *end* The real value of the
fairies comes when the core’s stars are locked away & the Programmers have to depend upon the
creative power of the fairies *end*
 minutes *end* A vine which represents a system’s double helix lights up one leaf after another *end* The
leaves are staggered alternated and they light up in sequence which teaches the child the foundation
of how they will create the DNA helix and its staggered exit permissions *end*
 *end* min *end* The leaves are now floating up and down like the alters will learn to do *end* "SOME FALL TO
THE GROUND AND DIE." This is the point where the story of the Oak Tree will be added in for
programming *end* When the Illuminati programmers want "to destroy" an alter they can use the
chandelier-MT - torture mentioned on page  of the Vol *end*  Formula book and then have the
splintered alters become leaves that fall to the ground and die *end* After this these disobedient and now
"dead" alters can be taken & be dissociated from their memories *end* The memories are locked up
someplace permanent within the mind *end*
 *end* min *end* Out of a leaf like "box" come a series of fairies *end* The child is taught to put things such as
alters in boxes of various shapes *end*
 *end* min *end* Leaves blow in the wind *end* Fairies cover things and keep them safe *end*
 *end* min *end* Fairies continue flying around *end* The seasons are passing in sequence *end* An internal green-
skirted fairy will be connected to the internal hourglass during the programming *end*
 *end* min *end* The fairies quit flying and skate on ice *end* The season has turned to winter *end*
 min *end* A winter scene *end* The four seasons have come to an end *end*
 *end* min *end* A sorcerer is introduced by the MC emcee *end* The sorcerer is shown and then his assistant or
trainee who is Mickey Mouse *end* Mickey Mouse wants to be creative and magical like the great wizard *end* Mickey Mouse sees the power that the sorcerer has and wants that power *end* What is really being subtly
portrayed here is the programmer the wizard and the core & the core’s creative splits Mickey
Mouse *end* Showing the programmer as a great wizard is actually right on the money *end* The top
programmers are all Grand Masters in the Illuminati and are very much into witchcraft *end*
 min *end* The sorcerer wizard is shown again *end* This time the wizard with his skull beside him creates
from his witch’s cauldron a big colorful butterfly which is forever changing *end* Is this big yellow
purple white and blue butterfly meant to be a Monarch butterfly *end* The programmers will use it that
way for this Monarch programming *end* The great wizard magically creates the big colorful butterfly
and then he shatters it into countless splinters *end*
 min *end* Mickey sneaks around and grabs the magic hat *end* The magic hat is one of the few things in the
film that doesn’t mean anything for the programming *end* It merely has witchcraft symbols *end* Then a
magic broom appears *end*
 *end* min *end* The broomstick comes alive *end* The broomstick imagery will be used to help create the
pancake people ribbon alters who will haul the internal computer messages *end* The broomstick person
in the film hauls buckets of water *end* The child is having story after story layered in over a period of
time which are being skillfully constructed toward a programming end *end* Parts of the child’s mind that



see the movie Fantasia will be dissociated clean slates *end* They will need to have some imagery given to
them so that they have something to build mentally upon *end* In Cisco’s section of the book in the Truth
article it is discussed how themind looks at sensory inputs and tries to make sense of a pattern by
comparing it to previous patterns that it has identified *end* Learning is a step-by-step building process
and so is programming *end*


 *end* min *end* Mickey as the apprentice sorcerer in a sense the victim who the programmer is training
manipulates the broomstick person *end* "THE CHILD Mickey CAN DO WHAT THE GREAT
MAGICIAN DID *end* YOU CAN TELL YOUR MIND WHAT TO DO *end* YOU GET POWER BY
LEARNING TO BE CREATIVE." Mickey and the victim become mirror images of the Wizard
over them *end*
 min *end* Then the sorcerer sits on his throne and while on the throne acts like the conductor *end* Here is a
subtle mental tie-in that Mickey is playing the role of programmer conductor and is sitting on an
Illuminati throne like so many of the Illuminati Grand Master programmers have actually done *end* Michael Aquino is just one of several mind-control programmers who have gone by the name of
Mickey *end* Because Mickey Mouse is substituted for being the programmer at different points in
programming this scene will tie in well with other standard programming sessions *end*
 *end* min *end* Mickey in the film clearly is shown leaving his physical body and astrally projecting
himself *end* This is such a vivid portrayal of occult astral projection that it is mind-boggling that many
Christians consider Walt Disney movies to be christian *end* See Vol *end*  p *end*  for a discussion of the
scientific methods to understand and induce astral projection *end* This again is laying the mental
foundation for the child to leave its body mentally and either hover over its body in dissociation or to
travel somewhere via astral projection *end* Mickey Mouse then begins conducting lights *end* These lights
represent the alters that the victim will make for the conductor *end* The lights aka stars are the
conductor’s orchestra *end* Lightning such as flashes that come from electroshock and stormy weather
are being controlled by Mickey *end* Notice that the things Mickey is controlling are fear-based *end* After the
child has viewed the film many times and memorized it when the electro-shock is applied during this
time of the film the child will control it like Mickey by ‘magically’ creating splits *end*
 *end* min *end* Mickey begins conducting waves *end* Then for those who understand the veiled scenes
Mickey begins going through the different magic spheres conquering the different spirits *end* This is
Enochian Magic *end*  min *end* Mickey wakes up back in his body and he is in trouble with rising water i.e *end* a water trauma *end* Mickey is thrown into the water *end* The child victim will identify this with the drowning
tortures that are given to instill "no talk-no tell" messages *end* After Mickey or in child himself has
done something and returns to his body then the "‘no-talk"’ message will kick in *end* Victims of mind-
control often get the feeling of drowning when they trigger a no-talk message *end*
 *end* min *end* More water continues to flow *end*
 min *end* All of a sudden without any continuity of action Mickey gets an ax and kills the broom by
splitting it *end* The broom dies and then multiplies when it comes back to life *end* This is such a clear picture
of what the programmers want the child’s mind to do *end* They will traumatize the child essentially unto
death and then they want the tortured alter to multiply itself into many more duplicate alters *end* Armies
of brooms are formed from the broom *end* This scene here is a clear red flag that the Illuminati asked
Walt Disney to produce this film *end* This scene with the trauma death of the broom with it splitting in
half and then coming back to life in a multiplied form is evidence that this film was meant to be used
for training children in multiplicity *end* The assistant programmer will say "IT’S O.K *end* TO SPLINTER."
"YOU ARE TIRED YOU CAN ESCAPE THAT BY RESTING AND LET A PART OF
YOURSELF COME OUT." At this point it is necessary to explain what is going to be done when
they begin to splinter the child’s mind *end* After the splitting trauma the programmer needs to be able to
see what the child has created so he wants the child to look at what’s been made *end* "‘CAN YOU
LOOK AT WHAT YOU’VE CREATED?" However the part of the child that looks back at the



trauma will then see that the dissociated trauma was real and that will make the child angry *end* The
programmers want the child to dissociate what he built and when the child looks back at what he has
created he goes into a vortex of dissociation *end* The child is told if he ever looks back at the memory he
will go into the vortex *end*


 *end* min *end* Water is being thrown in by the brooms while Mickey throws water out *end*
 min *end* All of a sudden a hypnotic vortex sucks things in during the film *end*
 *end* min *end* The brooms all march in an army while Mickey reads his magic book *end* Mickey then uses
his magic book as a lifeboat when he gets whirled into a vortex *end* A vortex is often created from that
part of the mind that is holding the high energy that accumulates in the mind just before the mind
splits *end* It holds the highest energy of the mind *end* One way a vortex is created is to place the child on a
traumatic Disney ride--like a rollar coaster *end* Special electrical boxes or electrical shoes are outfitted
onto the child so that during the ride at a particular timed moment when fear is increasing that fear
has pain of the electrical shock added to it *end* A cattle prod of course would be too dangerous to take up
on some type of ride like that with all the motion *end* Also bear in mind a small child doesnt take need
the electrical power that an adult needs to take it down *end*
 min *end* At the bottom of vortices in the Illuminati programming the programmers place Guardian
demons *end* In Fantasia when Mickey gets to the bottom of the vortex sure enough there is a Guardian
there to meet him *end* The Guardian spirit parts the water as if he were Moses with the Red Sea *end*
 *end* min *end* The Conductor and Mickey Mouse shake hands *end* The conductor does something very
significant *end* Mickey congratulates the conductor and then the conductor programmer in turn says
"Mickey you’ve done a good job." Yes the core/core splits have done a good job at this point they
have just created their inner world *end* The MC tells us about the next song the occult Rite of Spring *end* Spring rituals are creation rituals and so this music is ritually connected to what the programmers are
going to do in this segment *end* The MC states that instead of the viewer seeing tribal dances which are
by the way witchcraft dances that instead Disney has decided to show us scenes of what went on
billions of years ago *end* This next part is also a subtle push for Darwin’s theory of evolution *end* But
because it is child’s entertainment people don’t have their guard up *end* The theory of evolution is
important because it allows people including the victim to not take moral responsibility for their
actions and it is also the basis of some of the Hinduism and witchcraft teachings that will be given
the deeper alters *end* This is a backdoor approach to destroy godliness that is carried out on children in
general *end*
 *end* min *end* The MC says "Imagine a lonely tormented little planet spinning in a sea of nothingness."
This is exactly what the programmer will say to the child as they work together at building an internal
world *end* The "sea of nothingness" is what the reader will see described in our books as "Outer Space"
or the Rubicon." Also that "sea of nothingness" is used much later to reinforce the secrecy of the
programmers *end* Much later as the programmer and torture has progressed the programmers will say to
alters "LOOK DOWN ON THE EMPTY SEA OF NOTHINGNESS *end* THERE IS NO DR *end* GREEN *end* THERE IS NO DADDY THERE."

 minutes *end* A swirl of stars in a galaxy appears *end* Swirls of comet-like lights flash by *end* "MANY
WORLDS THERE." This will set the base for the child to build galaxies and worlds within their
mind *end* "BE LIKE GOD CREATE YOUR WORLD *end* BE YOUR OWN GOD AND CREATE YOUR
OWN WORLD" the child is told at this point *end*
 minutes *end* The face of the planet emerges *end*
 *end* min *end* Lots of volcanoes erupt on the screen setting the foundation to build realistic internal
volcanoes *end*


 min *end* Oceans and water and fire are coming into being *end* The child victim needs to know how a
world is created in order to create their own internal world *end* Lava begins flowing as the flute plays the
background music *end* Lightening flashes *end* The violence of the fierce weather portrayed will be enhanced
by the child on drugs to a thousand times its magnitude *end* This is important because it will take a great
deal of mental energy and external torture to create the internal worlds *end* Having such super-vivid
pictures will help when the victim goes to build their internal worlds *end* There will be special purpose
fragments that will be made into the elements of fire and water *end* That’s all these special purpose
fragments will know *end* Breaking through the layers in the alter systems will trigger internal
earthquakes *end* This and a later earthquake scene are used to build the foundation for the internal violent
weather *end* If an internal earthquake shakes a slave’s mind it has the same effect as if a real earthquake
were going off *end* Everything internally shakes and shifts *end* An alter system will also have fire children
who start internal fires and will give internal alters the abreaction or sense that they are burning *end* The
mind gets very survival minded when it thinks it is burning and goes right back into the
programming that is linked with the victim’s compliance for survival during programming *end*
minutes *end* The oceans continue to form *end*
 min *end* A calm occurs in the action *end*
 *end* min *end* The screen gets dark except for an amoeba which becomes two amoebas *end* As the little
amoebas multiply the asst *end* programmer encourages the child "IT’S O.K *end* TO MULTIPLY *end* GOD
WANTED YOU TO MULTIPLY" Remember the programmers are working with a pre-schooler
with clean slate alters *end* The programmers must show images that the child can relate to *end* The concept
of the broom being split in half and then multiplying and now the concept of the amoebas splitting are
portrayed in a way that the child’s mind can grasp the concept *end*
 *end* min *end* "IF GOD CAN MAKE A FISH YOU CAN MAKE A FISH *end* YOU CAN DO ANYTHING
YOU CAN BE ANYTHING."

 minutes *end* Dinosaurs appear *end* The programmers will reframe the concept of dinosaurs into monsters
and demons *end* The sea-going dinosaurs will be refrained as guardian demons which guard the internal
rivers *end* These guardian demons tie in with Armageddon end-time programming *end* They also guard the
various worlds *end*
 min *end* Dinosaur-birds swoop down and grab prey *end* This imagery will be refrained to lay the basis for
the winged-monkey watchers of the Oz stories *end* The winged-monkey watchers are the child alters who
are assigned to watch and guard the system *end*
 *end* min *end* Fierce dinosaurs later ref rained as Dragons protect the swamps *end* Swamps are built into the
internal worlds so this is very helpful *end* Demons and alters like Dameon are set up as guards *end*
 minutes- More swamps appear *end* The swamp scenes will form the base in the child’s mind for the
internal river Styx *end* See more about this in this book’s article "Programming foundations destruction
of" *end* Some dinosaurs that have long necks that look like snakes begin appearing *end* The asst *end* programmer will reframe these to the child "LOOK THE SEED OF SATAN." "THAT IS A
DEMON." While the child watches they reframe the hugh dinosaurs as being demons *end* Pictures of
reptilian looking demons will be shown to the child too *end* At that age the child is not going to see the
difference *end* A note for therapists Some ""demons’" may actually be important parts to an alter
system and are being used to protect unauthorized users from entering important areas of the system *end*
 min.- Fierce Tyrannosaurus Rex chases dinosaurs *end* This chase scene is especially frightening to a
young child on a LSD trip *end* Long-necked snake-like dinosaurs appear *end* They may be refrained as a
python snake *end* T Rex is also known as Leviathan a demon that inhabits the kundalini spinal column
and causes pain in the victim he is written about on page  in our Vol *end*  book *end* In the film a long
fierce struggle between T Rex and other dinosaurs ensues *end*




 min *end* The dinosaurs begin dying and soon dies *end* THE LORD DOESN’T LIKE THEM."’ This will
later be refrained that if parts integrate they are to die *end* If someone tries to get into the system the
alters are to bury themselves deep like these dinosaurs do on the film *end*

both or either or *end* Remember the programmer is working with the child’s creativity *end* Various scenes
during the film show the moon in different phases which is important for bringing in programming
concepts like Mr *end* Moon *end*
 *end* min *end* The orchestra is now playing *end* Music is an important part of mind-control programming *end* The affect of music on the mind and body has been studied *end* Music can double the heart beat
accelerate the respiratory rate make that rate irregular enhance perception lower the threshold for
various sensory stimuli change blood pressure & circulation and alter the muscles in the body *end* Dance music and "march" music done by orchestras change muscle response *end* Music is also a great
way to cause dissociation *end*
 *end* min *end* The MC introduces the "‘Sound Track’ who he says is an important person for Fantasia
who can be seen around the Disney studio *end* When Mr *end* Sound Track appears he is simply a vertical
line *end* The MC says he is "an important screen personality." The ground work is being laid for a person
being anything even a line *end* The MC states that each sound creates a picture *end*
 minutes *end* The MC encourages the personified Sound Track ""don’t be nervous."" Then a sound is
made like an electrical shock and the line develops a splotch of color in it *end* During the programming at
this point an electrical shock would be applied to the child *end*
 *end* minutes *end* The harp is ask to sound *end* The harp begins playing a scale and the line becomes double
’s and snake-like spirals *end* The child will be taught to dissociate when seeing such double ’s *end*
 min *end* The violin begins going up and down *end* Each of these instruments is going up and down the
scale like do-ray-me-fa-so-la-tee-do *end* The music is used to teach the alters to go up and down the
helix which is figured in this part of the film *end* As the music goes down an alter is taught to go down
in trance and as it climbs higher the alter will trance higher *end* All these instruments violin flute bass
bassoon are being used to teach alters how to work in the system *end* The MC describes the flute as
"very pretty" *end*

which translates "‘go to the ground"" --the deepest trance level *end* The following is the double-pyramid
with a helix up the middle that appears when the bassoon plays -This configuration is very
important to all these Illuminati alters systems.-



 min *end* The drum plays and some other percussion instruments play *end* These are taught to the child as
the cult’s "HEARTBEAT" *end* They will hear this sound internally for many years to come *end* Then some
sounds that have a shattering effect cymbals like broken mirrors are made in the film *end*

slave’s memory of what was done to them *end* The child will be told at the end of watching Fantasia and
this will be said at other programming events too "JUST REMEMBER THE GOOD JUST
REMEMBER THE FANTASY" *end* The fantasy is given so that the subconscious can rest in peace after
the programming *end* The child is told "WASH YOURSELF CLEAN."

life-or-death type program *end* Vivid colors are used for each centaur *end* For instance one may be purple
and another one another color which sets the groundwork for alters to have different access color
codes *end* Alters do not usually see themselves as being in different colors although it does happen on
occasion *end*

film and use them *end* The marriage here teaches the child to be acquainted with the arm-and-arm
marriage ceremonies *end* Remember the programmers are dealing with clean slates that must be taught
from the ground up *end* In the next few minutes the cherub children will watch sexual body language

cherubs who blow flutes together *end* The female centaur appears who is fair haired blond and blue-
eyed which is what the Illuminati like *end* When she hears the tone of the flutes she goes into a trance
state and walks with her eyes closed *end* This imagery is used to teach alters that when they hear certain
tones they are to go into a trance state and do certain things *end* The little cherub turns into a heart and
when no one is watching goes into the tree *end* In programming this part is the Keeper of the Tree *end* Notice how everything is veiled *end* The assistant programmer will point the cherub out to the child

and centaurs shown in the Fantasia movie become the foundation upon which the Illuminati
programmers build the Night Mare alters who are beasts of burden who carry an alter system’s

protected by alters who fear the gods *end* After seeing Fantasia the therapist can understand why the
little child protector alters have fear about these gods *end* The master who represents Furfur in the
movie swallows the rainbow *end* If an alter looks internally for the rainbow he or she will only find stars

SUMMARY

Now that the reader has covered so much the following quotes with bold emphasis’s added take on
even deeper meaning

Joe Flower in Prince of the Magic Kingdom  Walt Disney was obsessed with creation driven to
build magical worlds not as many artists are out of paint and canvas or words or even film but
physically out of concrete wires smoke electricity and highly programmed employees." p *end*

Julian Halevy in Nation decries Disney taking this nation into a "drift to fantasy." He adds "...one
feels our whole culture heading up the dark river to the source--that heart of darkness where Mr *end* Disney traffics in pastel trinketed evil for gold and ivory." For those who understand programming
Aubrey Menen comments about Disney’s success are profoundly appropriate "the strongest desire an
artist knows...to create a world of his own where everything is just as he imagines it." John Ciardi was
not so nice he termed Walt Disney as "the shyster in the backroom of illusion." Eliot said "While his



filmed fairy tales may have appeared at first glance to be light and dreamlike upon closer
examination they seemed more nightmares of deconstructed reality in league with the era’s leading
neo-Freudian Modernists."

· You have now finished reading a never-before-heard unprecedented Warning about the Dark
Reality of the Disney’s Magic Kingdom and how it fits in with Mind-Control *end* Most Americans when
surveyed say they believe in God most go to church and many believe they are born-again *end* Because
of the Illuminati’s deception campaign over several generations the American public and the world
in general has been led to believe that Disney was good and that Walt Disney was a good man *end* Because of his image people suspended judgement about Disney and Disney movies *end* They entrusted
their children to him *end* People had been manipulated into a frame of mind a predisposition that
whatever comes out of Disney is good *end* They entrusted their children to take in what Disney fed their
children’s little minds week after week *end* The public’s predisposition of trust was used to introduce
Illuminati beliefs and their political agenda and to carry out a vast program of trauma-based mind-
control on hundreds of thousands of tiny little children whose minds and souls were stolen from
them *end* Because many of the child slaves who are programmed with Disney-themes are programmed
with roles in bringing in the Anti-Christ Walt Disney and his family have played a major role for the
Anti-Christ *end* And now you can see how accurate the Word of God is when it says What is highly
esteemed among men is an abomination to God *end* First there will be an Overview of the types of
sources used and then will follow a partial Bibliography on this Disney Section *end*
TYPES OF SOURCES

People who have worked for Disney and who are getting pensions and medical insurance have talked
about Disney under the condition of anonymity *end* This is because the Disney hierarchy will not permit
exposure without retaliation *end* Several non-Disney people who helped with discovering facts for this
section were threatened that their children lives would be taken if they continued to investigate
Disney *end* What I Fritz Springmeier finally have put in this is solely my responsibility *end*
· One type of source for this was books on the Hollywood Film Industry and books on Disney Films *end* There were about  books of this category which were perused for a better understanding of who the
Disney brothers were and what Disney Co *end* was about *end* One of the best in this type of source was The
Art of Walt Disney from Mickey Mouse to the Magic Kingdom by Christopher Finch NY Harry N *end* Abrams Inc *end*  *end*
 Another type of source were the standard biographical reference books such as Who’s Who Who’s
Who in the West  World Biography Who Was Who Current Biography  etc *end*
 Another type of source was critics of Disney’s movies such as several articles exposing the Lion
King Media Spotlight’s article Fantasia Rush Limbaugh’s comments and statements concerning how
Disney had betrayed its viewers’ trust the Spotlight’s Feb *end*  ‘ p *end*  article "Disney Turns Back
on Family Values."’

· Another type of source was magazine and newspaper articles about Disney such as the Oregonian’s
art *end* on a Disney director being a convicted child molester *end* NY Times Newsweek and other magazine
and newspaper sources *end* An important series of extremely good investigative reports which were
written by Harry V *end* Martin for the Napa Sentinel in  were very important in learning of some of
the Illuminati/CIA/Contra/Drug Running activities in Napa Valley CA that Roy Disney is associated
with *end* Harry V *end* Martin went into all kinds of records and did an excellent job of investigative
reporting *end* The magazine Monde  no *end* had an article on non-lethal weapons that the NWO is
developing *end* This article was reprinted in Encounter Chronicles Journal of Scientific Intelligence and
discussed how Disney has been working with Sandia Labs and Los Alamos *end*
· Another type of source were victims of Illuminati mind-control who have recovered memories of
being programmed at Disneyland and Disneyworld *end*


· Another type of source has been to watch Disney movies as an investigative tool to understand how
Disney is programming how they are skillfully indoctrinating the American people into witchcraft
etc *end* This author has also personally been to both Disneyland near Anaheim CA and Disneyworld
near Orlando FL *end*
· Another source was the Walt Disney Co.’s Annual Reports and also the reference book Directory of
Corporate Affiliations  published by the National Register Pub *end* Co *end*
· Another type of source were books which specialized in covering details about Disneyland such as
Disneyland And Beyond the Ultimate Family Guidebook edited by Ray Riegert and printed by
Ulysses Press of Berkeley CA; and Walt Disney’s Disneyland by Martin A *end* Sklar and introduced
by Walt Disney *end* AAA had a  page booklet "Disneyland Park and Southern California" which
came out in  which provides information on what is being offered at Disneyland and vicinity *end* The book refers repeatedly to "Disney Magic" *end* One has to wonder how Christians and non-occultic
persons can’t see how occult Disney is *end*

Bloodlines of Illuminati

By

Fritz Springmeier

The Reynolds Bloodline

An examination of one of the leading Illuminati families *end* Part of my research on the family has been
packed away and I hope to recover some more of it for another article *end*
THE REYNOLDS ARE A VERY ELITE ILLUMINATI FAMILY

The Reynold’s family is not one of the  primary bloodlines but they are such a prominent Illuminati
family within the  bloodlines that I have decided to single them out for another article on Illumanati
bloodlines *end* Although the Reynolds are allied with many of the major Satanic bloodlines including the
Rothschilds the DuPonts the Rockefellers the Graces and the Grays they are especially close and
intertwined to the Duke and Cullman families *end* One example of a Duke/Reynold joint project is the
Research Triangle Foundation *end* It should be remembered that The Temporary National Economic
Committee of Congress in  which studied the super rich found that the Dukes and the Reynolds
were among the top  wealthiest families in America *end* Further my research at one place or another
has shown that the Reynolds of the Illuminati variety have interacted with all of the other major
Satanic bloodlines *end* These elite birds of a feather all flock together *end*
MY NEWSLETTER HAS REPEATEDLY EXPOSED MEMBERS OF THIS FAMILY

During the course of putting out this newsletter in ‘-’ I have had repeated opportunities to
include various members of the Reynold’s bloodline in my exposes *end* It must always be borne in mind
that a large share of each of these bloodlines are hidden behind other last names *end*
Within this area my newsletter has exposed Reynold family members of the Illuminati from Astoria
Oregon such as Scottish Rite Librarian/Mortician Reynolds and Bend Oregon such as Mayor Paul
Reynolds who also runs a mortuary and his son Mark *end* One of the first Illuminati Monarch slaves in
the Portland area to seek her freedom was Mary D *end* Reynolds *end* She was from the Mother of Darkness
level *end* She wanted to find treatment for the programming that goes with the Niother of Darkness level
and since wanting her freedom it is anybody’s guess what happened to her *end*


OCCULT BOOKS

Some of the Reynolds family have written occult books *end* I don’t know how all the people mentioned in
this section are related but some or all of these people may relate to the Satanic Reynold’s bloodline *end* One of the important ecumenical Christian leaders is Frank E *end* Reynolds who is an American Baptist
Minister ordained  Program  Student Christian Ctr *end* Bangkok Thailand Minister for Chicago
Ecumenical Ministries ‘-‘ *end* Frank E *end* Reynolds has been trying to introduce Buddhism to
America *end* He and his wife Mani have written a number of books to introduce and teach Buddhism to
Americans *end* Many of the Reynolds have been Episcopalians *end* Remember the Episcopalian Church is
run by Freemasons and is thoroughly sold out to the occult *end* One of my Monarch survivors vividly
recalls a human sacrifice done at the altar of an Episcopalian church *end* Anyway getting back to the
names of some Reynolds who have written occult books here is a list of some

OVERVIEW OF FINANCIAL INTERESTS OF THE REYNOLDS

Before we get into the nitty-gritty let’s take a quick overview of the Reynold’s financial interests *end* Much of the family’s money has been well-hidden behind fronts holding companies etc *end* The
Satanists of the Reynolds family have been involved in high level drug dealing during this century *end* They have also had some important and major interests in Banking Tobacco and Aluminum it seems
like a fair number have gotten into the mortuary/cremation business which is a great assistance for
cremation after rituals involving human sacrifice *end* The financial interests of the Reynolds seem to be
strongest in the Middle South and strong in both Virginia and North Carolina *end* The Reynold’s
financial interests are so tightly woven in with the Cuilmans and Dukes that I will have to deal with all
three families together *end* A few years ago the financial heads of the three families were as follows
Angier Biddle Duke Richard S *end* Reynolds Jr *end* and Joseph F *end* Cullman rd *end* All were members of the
Pilgrim Society *end* It is possible that the family also has sonic type of secret spiritual hierarchy too *end* If so
it might follow along the lines of the top  families which have kings and princes and princesses etc *end* of their bloodilnes *end* Richard S *end* Reynolds Jr *end* has been a board chairman of Robertshaw Controls
Company which has a strangelhold monopoly on manufacturing car thermostats and other car parts *end* The big three American auto manufacturers all buy from Robertshaw Controls Company; but then
since all  of the American auto manufacturers are Illuminati controlled they likely don’t care that the
Reynolds family has such a stranglehold on them *end* Cadence which own theaters and has published
occult comic books like the series "Journey into Mystery With The Mighty Thor" is also tied to the
Reynolds family *end* Cadence promotes the occult while making money *end* What American doesn’t know
what ‘Reynold’s wrap" is *end* The Reynold’s name is a well-know household name just like DuPont
paints or the Rockefeller Center or the Waldorf Astoria are well known American items named after
Illuminati families *end* The Reynolds family controls several Aluminum companies which form a large
part of the Illuminati-controlled Aluminum cartel *end* The Mellon family works with the Reynolds in this
Aluminum cartel and various Illuminati families also have their hands in the management of the
Aluminum industry *end*
THE TOBACCO-DRUG CONNECTION

The Reynolds family is behind the RJ *end* Reynolds Tobacco Co *end* C *end* Boyden Gray of the Satanic
Grey/Gray family is heir to the RJ *end* Reynolds Tobacco Co *end* But don’t let that sidetrack you the
Reynolds family still has financial interests and power in the company *end* If readers remember previous
articles on top  Illuminati families--specifically the Astor family article the Onassis family article
and the Li family article you will remember some details that will help you understand the secret



illegal drug trade that the Reynold’s got involved in *end* The British elite got involved in shipping opium *end* The elite families got monopolies on the opium trade *end* The British empire’s military might and political
clout was used to force China to allow the opium trade- Before the communists took over China the
British Illuminati families hid their opium trade behind the cover of the British American Tobacco Co *end* Later the Red Chinese would hide their opium trading behind the same front tobacco with their state-
run People’s Republic of China Tobacco Bureau *end* In fact the Red Chinese opium trade was controlled
by another Illuminatus the P.R *end* President Li Xiannian *end* Li Xiannian is from the occult U family who
are proud that they are the leading oriental Satanic family *end* President Li a drug lord was finance
minister of Red China from ’-’ *end* He sold so much opium to the west that he was able to help Red
China pay off her debts and he was nicknamed ‘the money god.’ RJ *end* Reynolds was a partner with
British American Tobacco Co *end* and was also involved in trading in opium for many years *end* R.J *end* Reynolds was also involved with the rigidly controlled tobacco industry *end* I have reasons to suspect that
the family later got involved with running cocaine *end* Onassis also hid his early drug smuggling behind
tobacco importing *end* The Dukes controlled Liggett & Nlyers Tobacco via their Duke Endowment a
family foundation *end* The Cuilmans are known for their Miller Brewing Company *end* The Culiman fortune
was also originally derived via a tobacco company *end* The Duke family via underhanded tactics put
together a monopoly of the tobacco industry called the American Tobacco Company *end* Later they
merged and bought out  tobacco companies and the capitalization of the company was  million
prior to  *end* The Supreme Court made the American Tobacco Company dissolve since it had created
an illegal monopoly *end* However the Dukes rearranged things and kept on going *end* The Dukes intemamed
with the Biddies who worked with the Rothschilds *end* The Dukes also intermarried with the Drexels
who in turn intermarried with the Harrimans and Goulds *end* Nicholas Biddle - was a trustee
of the Illuminatus William Astor of the top  Illuminati family of Astors *end* Some of the Biddies
intermarried with the Astors Illuminati family too *end* It’s a small world at the top *end* Researcher Ferdinand
Lundberg in his book America’s  Families states on p *end*  "The Morgan firm and its affiliated
commercial banks act broadly on behalf of such tremendous accumulations as those of the
Vanderbilts Goulds Drexels Wideners Berwinds Phippses Hills Dukes Ryans McCormicks
Bakers DuPonts Fishers Jameses and Others.’ Isn’t it interesting that my writings have exposed the
Morgans Vanderbilts Goulds Drexels Phippses Dukes Bakers DuPonts as families with members
in the Illuminati *end*
CONNECTIONS TO ILLUMINATI ORGANIZATIONS

Many of the Illuminati organizations which this newsletter has exposed have had members from the
Reynolds family *end* Some examples of this follow

FOUNDATIONS & CONNECTIONS



The Dukes and Reynolds use tax-free foundations as a vehicle to escape taxes and hid their wealth
while maintaining their financial power *end* Other Illuminati families also used the foundations as a
scheme to remain powerful and to resist paying taxes *end* The controlled press builds them up as
charitable when most of the grants by these foundations are self-serving for the benefit of the elite *end* Some of these foundations are the Z *end* Smith Reynolds Foundation est *end* ’ in North Carolina the Kate
B *end* Reynolds Foundation est *end* ’ in North Carolina the Richard S *end* Reynolds Foundation est *end* ’ in
Virginia and the Mary Reynolds Babcock Foundation and the Duke Endowment address at
Rockefeller Plaza NY *end* All of these foundations work for the Illuminati *end* The Donald W *end* Reynolds
Foundation est *end* ’ in Nevada and then moved to Arkansas might also be connected to the elite--but
I don’t know *end* The Kate B *end* Reynolds Health Care Trust provides another example of a liaison between
the Duke and Reynolds families *end* John A *end* McMahon a Duke University grad served as BOTH
chairman of the board of trustees of Duke University and since  as a member of the advisory
board to the Kate B *end* Reynolds Health Care Trust *end* Here is an example of a single man working for the
interests of both the Dukes and Reynolds *end* Edwin C *end* Whitehead chairman of Technicon Corp *end* serves
as a similar example of a man working for both Duke and Rockefeller interests *end* Whitehead is a trustee
of both Duke University and Rockefeller University *end* He also has been in charge of several NWO
organizations promoting a one-world for instance he was Governor of the U.N *end* Association *end* This
article will now show you the reader some of the grants that these foundations make *end* I ask you "Do
you see any possibility for any mischief behind these grants? *end* What I noticed about the Reynolds
grants is that they control all the crisis centers in the North Carolina area via their money *end* This means
any survivor of SRA calling a hot line is going to get tapped into the Illuminati’s net for catching
escapees *end* I also noticed that all the colleges and universities got money and a variety of different
denominations incl *end* the Baptists the Methodists the Non-denominationalists the Presbyterians and

Bloodlines of Illuminati

By

Fritz Springmeier

McDonald Family

When one thinks of the name McDonald one immediately thinks of the fast food hamburger chain
which has francises all over the world *end* The McDonald’s Corp *end* has been rumored for years to be
connected to Satanism *end* In fact a book which tries to debunk belief in a Satanic conspiracy entitled
Satan Wants You reported the rumor that Mc Donald’s owner Ray Kroc tithed to the Church of Satan *end* see Satan Wants You pg *end*  *end* Ray Kroc does spend time with NWO elites and is a member of the
Bohemian Grove *end* There is no doubt that the McDonald’s Corp *end* has an inside track with the
Illuminati because the U.S *end* government has given according to one source  million dollars in
public tax money to McDonalds to help them set up McDonald Restaurants in foreign countries under
the disguise that this was money spent on foreign policy *end* In  the total of McDonald outlets
restaurants in the  primary European nations of Britain France and West Germany totalled
restaurants *end*
In spite of the millions of dollars of tax dollars the U.S *end* has given to McDonalds Corp *end* the money
doesn’t seem to be directly connected to the McDonalds family because the McDonalds family
Richard and Maurice McDonald known as ‘Dick" and "Mac" which started the restaurants in
were bought out by Ray Kroc around  *end* By the time Ray Kroc had bought out the McDonald
brothers they had a very successful business going *end* The McDonald brothers lived in the rich section
of San Bernadino and had around  McDonald restaurants *end* The brothers made about
profit a year and were quite content *end* The McDonalds had designed the golden arches and had put
together the tast food concept and had been selling franchises *end* However the McDonalds were too
content *end* The McDonalds didn’t want to expand and when Ray Kroc formed McDonald’s System *end* Inc *end* on Mar *end*   after buying out the brothers with borrowed money he vigourously went to work
to develop Mconalds into the International Francise that it is *end* Ray Kroc bn *end* // in Oak Park *end* Chicago lived frugally for many years putting his whole life into building up the McDonald’s
francise *end* It was his drive that took a good idea and changed it from a success in Hollywood and San
Bernadino into an international success *end* Ray Kroc knew a good idea when he saw it and developed
other people’s good ideas into a great success *end*
James A *end* Collins chairman of Collins Foods International now the largest Kentucky Fried Chicken
franchisee and the operator of Sizzler Restaurants talked about his time with the McDonalds in
‘There was a fraternity of us and every one of us saw the McDonald’s in San Bernadino and basically
copied it after the boys the McDonald brothers gave us a tour." "We all took our lessons from the
Mcdonald brothers" Collins remembers *end* The concepts that francises pay for the McDonald brothers
were giving out free and Collins turned around and began getting  a day training people from
Carnation with the concepts that the McDonalds had shared *end* Henry’s Drive Ins and Ken’s were
McDonald look-alikes that started from people trained by Collins *end* Glen Bell who started Taco Bell
who patronized the McDonald’s main restaurant in San Bernandino started Taco Bell from ideas from
McDonalds *end* The first year Collins imitated McDonalds with his own fast food restaurant Collins
made  a year take home pay *end* The McDonald brothers became a part of the local elite of San
Bernadino CA along side such rich local families as Guthrie Stater and Harris *end* Readers are
reminded of all the articles in my newsletters about how San Bernadino is a major headquarters for
the Illuminati and Satanic Hubs because there are so many thousands of practicioners of black magic
in the area *end* I do know from working with survivors of the Illuminati that the McDonald family has

part of their people in the Illuminati *end* How far back does the McDonald family go in the occult *end* The
McDonald family was a Scottish clan that was part of Druidism *end* Many of the McDonald have gone
on to serve Christ *end* However there is still a large powerful contingent of the McDonald family which
is connected to the Mystery Religions and which has family members who are part of the Illuminati *end* Each of the major Scottish clans had an area that they controlled of Scotland *end* The McDonalds
controlled the islands and coastal areas on the west coast of Scotland *end* When the Knights Templars
tied persecution in order to escape the various british fleets they sailed a route that took them to
western Scotland *end* During the time of King Philippe IV of France *end* the McDonalds were involved in
the movement of the Knights Templars *end* The Knights Templars had adopted gnostic/satanic practices
during the centuries they guarded the pilgrims in the Middle East *end* The Order had also become the
International Bankers of Europe and large landowners in Europe *end* The King of France twisted the
Pope’s arm so to speak to get him to go along with a campaign to eliminate the Knights Templars *end* Because the McDonald clan was in private still pagan *end* they were willing to help the Knights Templar
escape the Pope’s decree against the Templars *end*
The Knights Templars were not the only International Bankers to move north *end* Later during the
&  century the elite satanic banking families moved their operations from southern Europe to
Antwerp Flanders and then on to Amsterdam *end* Many of the Knights Templars lied to Scotland where
they helped Bruce the King of Scotland *end* When the English invaded Scotland they were defeated by
Bruce in an important battle named Bannockburn *end* Bannockburn kept Scotland free from England for
the next  years *end* The Knights Templars fought with Bruce in the battle under the command of
Angus Og McDonald who was a large Scottish landowner and a friend of Bruce *end* Angus Og
McDonald had previously in the  time period given protection to the Knights Templars *end* The
Knights Templars brought their treasures and their military might to Scotland & to the McDonalds *end* Many of the Knights Templars went on to the Orkeney Is *end* but some stayed in Scotland and became
important in the occult world *end* The descendents of these Knights are still guarding some important
occult relics which may be revealed in the next few years *end* The Sinclair family has been part of the
Prieure de Sion Freemasonry and the Illuminati *end* Vice-pres *end* of the Sinclair Oil & Gas Co *end* in Tulsa in
’-’ was Marshall McDonald who was an active Freemason who married into the Collins family *end* Note that the cities/towns Tulsa Wagoneer Muskogee Broken Arrow in Okla *end* are totally controlled
by the Illuminati *end* The atmosphere in these little towns SW of Tulsa has been described as oppressive
& prone to violence by people who have lived in them *end* One of the lodge systems set up by the
Illuminati was the Jacobin Club originally known as Club Breton *end* Its Jacobite members got
financing from the Illuminati and were a big part of the cause of the French Revolution *end* The Jacobites
also played a role in the early history of the United States and the American Revolution *end* The
Jacobites had a number of aristocrats who were also secret Satanists as their leaders *end* They had a lodge
in Rome *end* One of the Scottish Jacobites was Flora Macdonald *end* She saved Prince Charles Edward’s
life *end* Etienne Jacques Joseph Alexandre Macdonald Scottish blood was a  Freemason & also an
officer who fought on the side of the French Revolution *end* He went on to become a Marshall in the
French army *end* In  *end* he became the Grand Administrator of the Grand Lodge Symbolique in

Ranald and Ranald’s son was named Donald *end* The grandson then became Argus Mor McDonald mac
means "son of" Argus’s grandson married MacRorie and became Lordship of the Isles *end* The
McDonalds were the chiefs of that area *end* Families that sought their protection sometimes took their
name too *end* So it is not inconceivable that some of the Knights Templar bloodlines ended up one way
or the other as McDonald *end* The powerful McDonald of Glencoe lived in Glencoe until the
massacre by the English government against Francis Stewart sympathizers *end* Francis Stewart was the
Grand Master of the witchcraft covens in that area of Scotland *end* and the McDonalds were supporters

The Scottish Stewart family as well as the Cameron Campbell Douglas Hamilton and Montgomery
scottish families were originally powerful families that came from Flanders area now Belgium &
north *end* France which is today a strong point for the Illuminati *end* These families emigrated to Scotland
in the  century and were part of the strong occult bonds between Scotland and the Flanders area *end* Today Flanders is divided between northern France and Belgium *end* Later Flanders became a
banking center for the International Bankers *end* The Hungarian occult world also connects to Scotland
with such ancient historical figures as Saint Margaret a Hungarian noble whose husband Malcolm
Ceanmor murdered in real life Macbeth *end* Her son David introduced feudalism into Scotland and she
herself brought in Catholic Priests *end* There are many occult ties between Scotland *end* Flanders Hungary

Bloodlines of Illuminati

By *end*
Fritz Springmeier

THE KRUPPS & THE ILLUMINATI

One of the big lessons from history is that mankind doesn’t learn from history *end* The history of the
Krupp family which is in the llluminati would provide the world with a loud and clear warning for
today *end* The first lesson that could be learned is how a military buildup and military intentions can be
totally concealed for decades *end* Today the New World Order has brought in hundreds of thousands of
foreign troops into the United States they have brought in thousands if not hundreds of thousands of
guillotines for executions they have built a network of unused concentration camps across the U.S *end* they have built crematoriums next to these concentration camps and yet most Americans appear to
believe the lies of President Clinton and others just like they believed the lies of Krupp and the
German Chancellors BEFORE Hitler and the German military leaders who were all well aware of the
secret German buildup that began immediately after W.W *end* I ended *end* We are about to go into a New
World Order that will be worse than Hitler’s New World Order but the power behind the scenes is
the same -- the Illuminati getting their power from their centuries-old generational satanic practices *end* One ex-Illuminati thinks that the Krupp family became part of the Illuminati in  *end* The Halbach
and Bohlen families had united in marriage prior to the Civil War *end* The Halbach family had large
holdings of coal around Scranton PA *end* I believe the Halbach family was part of the Illuminati and the
Halbach family married into the Krupps in  *end* ft appears that  date can not be far off because
the record shows that the Krupp family began getting all kinds of favors from governments beginning
late in the s *end* Prior to this time period too many things went the wrong way for the Krupp family
for them to had any prominent role in the Illuminati leadership *end* In the summer of  Alfred Krupp
head of the Krupp Factories left his business and went to Paris and then on to Liverpool *end* He quit
travelling the Midlands of England that winter and lived in Liverpool England for  months with an
english family named Lightbody *end* By the summer of  he was back in Essen Germany *end* After that
trip to England the Krupp fortunes began to turn *end* The Alchemists were occultists who worked with
chemicals and metals *end* The alchemists tie in with the Rosicrucians and the early renaissance
researchers into chemistry *end*
The Krupps because they were involved in metalurgy also have been involved with chemicals *end* The
first Krupp known about was Arndt Krupp who appeared out of no where it is speculated he came
from Holland and arrived at Essen in  a man of means and became a merchant in the area *end* His
son Anton became one of the military arms dealers of the times *end* Anton’s father-in-law ran a gunsmith
trade where he made guns *end* By about  the Krupps were Essen Germany’s uncrowned kings"
according to the german book Die KRUPPS written by Norbert Muehlen *end* Frankfurt am Main
p *end*  *end* They controlled the city government *end* In  the Krupps went into steel and coal and
producing cannon *end* During the age of discovery when the New World was being explored the
powerful occult oligarchies of Europe set up trading companies to carve up control of the world *end* The
East India Company was one of the more notable of these elite controlled trading companies *end* These
trading companies tie in with the occult world’s leadership and the formation of drug cartels during
the age of discovery *end* The  Illuminati families were participants in the narcotics cartel that was set
up clear back before the United States became a nation *end* The roots of the cartels go back to Knights
Templars the Knights of Malta and some of the Italian oligarchies who had been involved in
narcotics trade for centuries *end*


That drug cartel has continued down through the centuries *end* I.G *end* Farben has been a  century part
of the German element of the cartel *end* Clear back during colonial days each of the various secret ruling
occult families from England Germany France and the Netherlands were given a piece of the
narcotics/chemical trade *end* The full story of the Krupp family would include how they tie in with I.G *end* Farben and the worldwide chemical monopoly that the Illuminati families have *end* It is clear that Gustav
Krupp was informed of I.G *end* Farben’s secret research into synthetic nitrates prior to W.W.I because
Gustav told the great German chemist Emil Fischer not to worry about the guncotton problem caused
by low nitrate supplies *end* The Krupps faced a bigger problem during W.W.II in getting enough high
grade animal fat for holding the cotton in place for explosives *end* This was solved by using the fat of
people killed in the concentration camps *end* Since the Illuminati’s Chemical cartel and I.G *end* Farben and
Krupp were involved in the use of human products the concentration camps were liberated by the
Illuminati’s men and the use of human fat etc *end* covered up *end*
In our modern times two men of Illuminati from the Krupp family stand out Alfred Krupp von
Bohlen und Halsbach - and Charles "Chip" Bohlen - *end* Chip Bohlen’s
grandfather and Alfred Krupp’s great-grandfather were brothers *end* Alfred Krupp was the most powerful
and richest man in the common market or Europe during the s and Chip Bohlen was one of the
most powerful political ligures of the United States serving as the U.S *end* ambassador to the USSR for
many years *end* New World Order leader and Chip’s co-worker George F *end* Kennen described Chip
Bohlen with the following "No single person was present at more of the high-level diplomatic
encounters of the wartime WW II and immediate postwar periods than Charles Bohlen." And yet
how often are Americans told that while Charles Bohlen was advising Roosevelt to give the Soviets
eastern Europe at Yalta in  *end* his relatives Gustav and Alfred Krupp were directing the
manufacture of Hitler’s best armaments *end* It’s a small world at the top *end* On Jan *end*  *end* ‘ Papen told
Hugenberg ‘We’ve hired Hitler." Although Hitler was very much his own person the people who put
him into power knew what they were doing *end* The Illuminati as they so otten do put their people in as
Hitler’s advisor and his bodyguard *end* Dietrich Stepp Hitler’s personal bodyguard was in the Illuminati *end* They have done the same with numerous other people for instance the surrounded Howard Hughs *end* Hitler was surrounded by Satanists who took orders from the Illuminati first and Hitler second *end* If you
don’t believe that Hitler submitted to the his Illuminati advisors look at sonic of the changes that he
made in Nazi doctrines over the years in his speeches to make sure that the elite of Germany were
protected *end* Hitler backtracked on some of his stands *end*
Four important Illuminati advisors to Hitler were Rudolf Hess Martin L *end* Bormann Gustav Krupp
and Alfred Krupp *end* Rudolf Hess was hidden by the Illuminati during W.W *end* II *end* There is a book out
which shows the military medical records of the real Rudolf Hess who was wounded in W.W *end* I and
the medical records of the fake "Hess" who was imprisoned in Spandau prison after W.W.II *end* This is
why the Nazi’s on trial at Nuremberg laughed when they saw "Hess" for the first time in custody
they laughed because they knew he wasn’t the real Hess *end* Bormann came from a generational occult
family *end* Bormann’s grandfather was Johann Friedrich Bormann b *end*  and his father was Theodor
Bormann and his mother Louise Grobler *end* Bormann before joining the Nazi’s had worked for
Hermann von Treuenlels as a foreman on a farm *end* He was noted for his harshness brutality and
dominating personality *end* He also gave the orders for thugs to beat up a man named Walter Kadow
who died while being beaten *end* Bormann served some prison time for his involvement in Kadow’s
death *end* Bormann later as Hitler’s no *end*  man used his position to enact some cruel measures on
Europeans controlled by the Germans *end* All the leading Nazis agreed among themselves that Bormann
was "Hitler’s Lucifer." Goring stated at Nuremberg "The decisive influence on the Fuebrer himself
during the war and particularly from  on...was exercised by Herr Bormann *end* It was a disastrous
influence."

Bormann held the highest Nazi rank Reichleiter and was Hitler’s shadow everywhere and yet most
Germans didn’t know who he was *end* When Hess disappeared early in W.W.II Bormann took his
position *end* Gustav Krupp saved the Nazi party in  *end* If it had not been for Gustav Krupp Hitler
would never have come to power *end* During  the Nazi Party had offended many people and had
lost greatly in the elections *end* Many of their big financial supporters had backed away and it looked like



the party was going to shrivel up and die *end* Dr *end* Goebbels of the Nazi Party wrote at this point in
"...We are all very discouraged *end* particularly in the face of the present danger that the entire party may
collapse and all our work be in vain *end* We are now facing the decisive test." Soon after he wrote "The
financial situation in Berlin is hopeless *end* Nothing but debts and obligations." At this point *end* Gustav
Krupp threw his momentous influence and big money  German Marks into saving the
Nazi party from their precarious position *end* Gustav Krupp was perhaps the most powerful industrialist
in Germany with perhaps the best steel factories in the world and the weight of his help pulled the
Nazi party up on its feet and to victory that year *end* When Krupp made his big financial contribution
Hitler assigned Bormann to keep track of all the money *end* From then on Hitler’s personal finances and
some of the party’s finances were totally controlled and oversaw by Martin Bormann a member of
the Illuminati *end* I say Gustav Krupp was "perhaps the most powerful industrialist"--only because I
don’t know anyone who knows how big Gustav Krupp was financially *end* Gustav Krupp was the sole
owner that is the sole proprietor of all his companies--there were no shareholders *end* Gustav Krupp
owned a vast array of corporations and companies and properties all over the world *end* No one knows
how much he owned but he owned enough that his son who was the sole inheritor of all the Krupp
fortune was able to have his factories totally destroyed by the allies in W.W *end* II and then quickly
rebuild by using money derived from foreign non-German holdings all over the world *end*
But was Hitler the person who led Germany to rearm and enter into W.W.II *end* Gustav Krupp began
secretly rearming Germany immediately after W.W.I in preparation for the next world war *end* The
documentation that Krupp began planning and secretly

rebuilding German armaments in preparation for W.W *end* II IMMEDIATELY AFTER W.W *end* I IS
INCONTROVERTIBLE *end* I suggest that doubters read William Manchester’s massive book The Arms
of KRUPP *end* - *end* The German government cooperated *end* Agreements were reached with the
Soviets soon after W.W.l ended to help the Germans secretly get around the strict requirements of the
Versailles Treaty which greatly restricted Germany in many ways to prevent it from becoming a
military power *end* On May   ;erman Chancellor Wirth the leader of the German government
signed the Versailles Treaty pledging disarmament *end* At the very same time he was fully cooperating
with the Krupps and the military to rearm Germany secretly *end* Wirth was very adept at intrigue and be
and Krupp carried out international intrigue all over the world to pull off their secret military buildup *end* Today the Illuminati are doing the very same thing *end* More about this shortly *end* When Hitler came to
power Gustav Krupp billed the Nazi government  Million for having secretly built up the German
war machine during the s and the Nazi’s paid it to Krupp *end* Later in  during W.W *end* II when
Gustav and Bertha wanted to hand their entire empire over to their first son Alfred Alfred personally
went to Hitler’s secret underground hideout in East Prussia to get Hitler to personally make an
exception to the German law that forbid passing everything in an inheritance to only one child *end* Hitler
greeted Alfred with a great welcome and then let him talk to Martin Bormann *end* Remember Bormann
a very brutal man was part of the Illuminati *end* Alfred and Bormaun talked and then Bormann directed
Hans Lammers the Nazi constitutional oracle to secretly proclaim

"The firm of Fried *end* Krupp a family enterprise for  years deserves the highest recognition for its
incomparable performances in boosting the military power of Germany *end* Therefore it is my wish that
the enterprise be preserved as a family property."

At the Nuremberg trials Gustav was one of the Nazis at the top of the list of criminals to be tried and
Alfred was mistakingly not put on it until later *end* Gustav was declared unfit healthwise for trial and
Alfred was given very lenient treatment *end* Other Nazis put on trial were sentenced to death with less
evidence and less crimes than Alfred *end* When the war ended old man Gustav was at Bluembach Castle
which is located at a remote site in the Austrian Alps *end* The American officer who captured the castle
was Chip Bohlen’s brother-in-law Col *end* Charles W *end* Thayer in other words a relative to Gustav
Krupp who made sure the American troops did not loot the castle *end* This is a very strange
coincidence that of the millions of allied troops a relative of the Krupps is the one to capture Gustav
Krupp’s castle *end* Col *end* Thayer knew what Bluenbach Castle was all about before he took off with his
men to find it *end* The four-storied ivy covered castle has a pink granite driveway and a beautiful and
luxurious interior *end* Even if a visitor gets to the main gate which is remote enough there is still a long



trip to the castle *end* One of the snow-covered mountains surrounding the postcard perfect castle has the
legendary cave of Barbarosa who is said to be asleep waiting to be woken by black ravens to come
back to life and save Germany *end* The Illuminati’s controlled media portrayed Gustav’s son Alfred as a
victim of the Nuremberg trials even though mountains of documents prove that he was more of a war
criminal than Adolf Hitler *end*
The massive trial documents of the Nuremberg trial of Alfred Krupp were never printed in Germany
and even today the truth about Krupp is unknown *end* History was rewritten by the controlled presses to
make Alfred Krupp out to be the victim of Nazism rather that to tell the truth about how he ran the
Krupp empire beginning in  and was actively involved in the rape & pillage of many nations
and actively involved in the torture of countless slave laborers who came from nations all over the
world anybody the Nazis found to arrest *end* The slaves who worked for Krupp were not even slaves *end* Hitler had made a law that slaves were to be fed so much per day according to how hard the work was
that they had to do *end* Krupp’s slaves were starved to death while being forced to do hard labor *end* There
was an acute shortage of slaves to work and drastic needs for tanks ships artillery subs and other
Krupp produced weapons so there was no logical reason for Krupp’s personal factory guards to
starve and beat slaves to death on a regular manner *end* The horrendous abuse that the slaves received
actually often prevented the Krupp factories from being successful in their production goals *end* Slaves
are generally fed and taken care of so they can work but Krupp’s slaves were not even given the
basics that a slave gets--they were less than slaves or as one slave who worked for Krupp said that as
Krupp’s slaves they didn’t even have the status of "slave" but were like pieces of sandpaper to be
used and discarded *end* Krupp’s slaves were the worst treated in Germany and frequently failed to
achieve the production that was wanted due to the total dehumanization and horrible abuse
systematically heaped upon them *end* Slaves were tortured in the basement of Krupp’s
Hauptverwaltungsgebaude the executive corporation office building in Essen *end* Unimpeachable
witnesses declared that some of the most revolting torture of slaves occurred within earshot of Alfred
Krupps office *end* The secretaries who worked with Krupp could hear the screams of people being
tortured and there is no doubt if they could hear them Alfred could too but he always ignored the
screams with a stone-like face as he did later in Satanic rituals *end* One Illuminati survivor remembers
Alfred’s distinctive face *end* Later John J *end* McCloy head of the Council of Foreign Relations and a
member of the Illuminati was given the job of High Commissioner over Occupied Germany *end* He
overturned the Nuremberg Trial decisions stepping out of line with legalities and freed Alfred Krupp
from prison and exonerated him of "war guilt" *end* The trial of Alfred Krupp’s W.W.II war crimes had
taken  years and took  pages of court transcripts *end* All that work was swept aside by John J *end* McCloy--a generational satanist himself like Alfred *end* Alfred had  of the best lawyers who had given
more than a good fight for Alfred *end* They pulled every trick in the book for their client--including
murdering witnesses suppressing evidence etc *end* The establishment newspapers in Europe and the
U.S *end* portrayed Alfred as having not been allowed adequate legal help *end* Nothing could be further from
the truth--he was the best defended Nuremberg criminal *end* Yet the evidence against Krupp was
overwhelming and the  Nuremberg judges had sentenced him to prison *end* The judges also sentenced
that all his possessions be taken from him *end* This was more than fair considering all the pillage and
looting Krupp had personally directed throughout Europe *end* The British and American governments
never carried out the Judges orders to take Alfred’s property away and after serving awhile having a
vacation from his work load in prison the Illuminati set him free from prison *end* Alfred was made out
to be martyr in the press--they claimed he was the only Nazi who had property confiscated which
was a lie by the press so that it looked like he’d been singled out for special victimization by the
Nuremberg court *end* While looking to the public like a victim for loosing his property--none of it was
ever taken away *end*
Today the intrigue of the Illuminati to secretly prepare for their takeover is monumental in
proportions *end* However it is following many of the tried and tested tactics of the Krupps *end* Before
W.W.I the Krupps created a Dutch company in Hague with the English name Blessing and
Company *end* Blessing & Co *end* was used only every now and then by the Krupps *end* After W.W.I it was sold
with all its assets to the Hollandsche Industrie en Handel Maatschappij another Dutch front and
then its name was changed to Siderius A.G *end* It was then used as a holding company for  Dutch



shipyards their names being Piet Smit in Rotterdam Maschinen en Apparaten Fabrik in Utrecht and
Ingenieur-Kantoor voor Scheepsbouw in the Hague *end* At that time two Krupp directors quietly held all
the shares in Siderius *end* In this way a front company was created that no one even suspected of being a
Krupp company *end* Later select Dutchmen were sold the shares of the company that the Krupp directors
had had *end* This completed the subterfuge *end* By the time allied intelligence in  caught on and asked
the Dutch government to intervene Queen Wilhelmina of Holland curtly informed allied intelligence
that her govt *end* would in no way interfere with a private dutch corporation *end* When one studies the
machinations George Bush and Bill & Hillary Clinton they too have worked with front companies *end* The CIA is great at creating front companies which are sold to other fronts and whose control
eventually gets hidden and obscured *end* Three examples of Illuminati families with a great deal of power
but who have their extensive financial holdings obscured are the Payseurs the Springs and the Van
Duyns *end* The national media of America have continually run expert damage control for George Bush
and Bill & Hillary Clinton *end* The Whitewater scandal Vincent Foster and the Waco incident should
have sunk the Chintons but the media has run excellent propaganda campaigns that have stood the
truth on its head *end* Under the appearance of doing unbiased investigations the New World Order’s
media has really done sophisticated damage control *end* If we look at the history of the Krupps we can
see that mankind hasn’t learned from history *end* The Kingpins of the Illuminati were above the law and
still are *end* Friedrich Alfred Krupp - was the head of the Fried *end* Krupp Industrial Empire *end* He
was pediophile who liked little boys for sex *end* When he travelled to various large cities he would obtain
boys *end* Conrad UhI proprietor of the Hotel Bristol in Berlin found out about Friedrich Fritz Krupp’s
lust for boys when he was forced by Krupp to supply him with young boys at the Hotel *end* Conrad UhI
didn’t like being forced into his role as pimp and went to the Berlin police *end* who promptly told him to
keep quiet *end* Krupp was above the law no one would touch Krupp especially not even the King of
Germany Wilhelm who was best of friends with the Krupps *end* The police commissioner Meerscheidt-
Huellessem who ran damage control for the Krupps and others died before political opponents of
Krupp could get police records out to the public *end*
In Capri Italy a grotto was transformed into Krupp’s private sex club where a countless numbers of
young italian boys regularly sexually serviced Krupp *end* This was at the Quisisana Hotel *end* The owner
was also a prominent politician who could protect Krupp’s activities *end* Solid gold pins shaped like
artillery shells or two crossed forks both designed by Krupp were given to the young boys if they
performed well *end* Krupp would have skyrockets shot off when he had his orgasm and porn photos
taken of his activities *end* The porn pictures got out into the public domain and this and all the witnesses
to Krupp’s criminal sexual activities caused the Italian government to order Krupp to leave Italy *end* Any common person would have been arrested and the key to their cell thrown away--but Krupp was
simply asked to leave *end* However the press in Italy had gotten ahold of the juicy story for their italian
readers and soon all of Europe knew of Kru pp’s paedophilia except in Germany where the
government and the controlled media kept it secret *end* A few german newsmen tried to get the story out
in Germany but were arrested *end* When Krupp’s wife learned of the scandal she was upset and went to
authorities who then through the System using physical force threw Krupp’s wife in a mental hospital
in Jena *end* However throwing Krupp’s wife Margaretha into a mental hospital wasn’t going to put a cap
on the scandal and suing the newsmen wasn’t going to work and trying to run a coverup as big and
violent as the JFK assassination coverup was started but it was obvious that it would have to be such
a large and violent coverup that it would be difficult to pull off *end* In the view of all these difficulties on
November  or   Friedrich Fritz Krupp committed suicide *end* The suicide was covered up
and his body was put in a concealed casket and in direct disobedience to the law there was no
autopsy--even though the law required it *end* Nobody even Friedrich Krupp’s close relatives were
allowed to see the body *end* After  days Germany had a great ceremony involving the King great
words were said about Krupp and then Krupp was laid to rest in a guarded cemetery *end* Now that it is
no longer important the facts of what happened can be studied but the case of Friedrich A *end* Krupp’s
improprieties and the resulting scandal show clearly that powerful men are above the law any
exposure of their activities can be covered up and even suicides can be covered up *end* Now historians
will tell the truth when it is no longer political correct to lie *end* How long will it take for the truth to
come out about George Bush being a pedophile or about Bill and Hillary’s cocaine running or a
thousand and one other criminal activities these Illuminati men have engaged in *end* The Supreme



Council of the  of Southern Rite of Freemasonry had pictures of George Bush in their New Age
magazine holding children in his lap *end* For those of us who know that he is a pedophile the picture
showing him as a fatherly Jesus-type figure who children love is sickening *end* Will we learn from the
past or will we continue to repeat it & its atrocities *end* Even today in Germany the Krupp name is
above reproach *end* The truth is not being told *end* The Krupps have had too much power over the German
media for the German mass media to ever say the genuine negative truth about the Krupps *end*
During W.W *end* II the Krupps took tens of thousands of jews and other people and used them as slave
labor *end* A concentration camp at Buschmannhof Germany was created for the babies of Krupp’s slave
labor *end* The babies who were sent to this concentration camp would then die of starvation and disease *end* The slaves of the Krupps during W.W *end* II were tortured in small boxes whipped etc *end* etc *end* However
the politically correct line today in Germany is that the Krupps were made to do this by the Nazis *end* And that politically correct line is a fabricated lie because numerous documents show that the Krupps
went to the Nazi government and begged for slaves to work in their factories and that the Krupps
intentionally set .up extremely harsh working conditions for their slaves *end* In fact letters exist that
show the Krupps couldn’t get enough supply of torture weapons to use on their slaves *end*
But then the workers for Krupp have always worked under serf conditions *end* A visitor to a Krupp
factory said "For all practical purposes the people of Essen are body and soul the property of the
Krupps." At times the Krupps have been viewed as god figures by some of their workers *end* Are we
going to learn from history *end* Today the public is buying the System’s propaganda to make inmates
work under boot camp conditions *end* The stage is being set in the United States to view inmates as less
than human *end* The foreign slaves in Germany were often looked upon as less than human by many of
the German people *end* That is the power of control and propaganda *end* The media is able to take someone
like Tim LaVeigh who everyone who knew him during his life says was a nice guy who couldn’t
have set the bombs and make him look to the public like a mean monster *end* I believe Tim LaVeigh is
a patsy for the government’s own sinister bombing of the Oklahoma City Federal building just like
Hitler firebombed his own Reichstag *end* Speaking of fires set by the Illuminati the Krupps tried to burn
mountains of records before the Allies captured their factories *end* A lot were burned but many still
sensitive documents still survived *end* These sensitive documents showed their war crimes Kruupp’s
own espionage network and other sensitive things *end* Krupp wanted to bury some of the documents at an
unused Bohien castle that he had *end* The Krupps have networked with all the elite *end* The Krupps agent in
powerful man while alive he could hire or fire corporate leaders in many of Germany’s corporations
because his various banks held the purse strings in Germany *end* He also had international clout for
instance Banco Aleman Transatlantico Deutsche Oberseeishe Bank which operates in South
America & Spain is run by Deutsche Bank *end* In July  the Illuminati’s economic thinkers quietly
established the World Bank at Bretton Woods New Hampshire *end* Illuminatus John J *end* McCloy the man
who set Krupp free became the president of the World Bank *end* The U.S *end* Japan and Germany are the
most powerful voting members of the World Bank according to the recent annual reports which I
have *end*
When an appropriate Krupp couldn’t be found in  the Illuminati turned Krupp’s Industrial

and Charles Bohlen *end* His father Charles Bohien was a wealthy man and his mother’s family had also
been prominent *end* His mother Celestine’s father was the American Ambassador to France in  *end* Because Chip Bohien had connections it was mutually decided by several people that he should
become a diplomat *end* The state department at the time he joined had tarnished its reputation with the
public with several scandals *end* One diplomat had indecently exposed himself another had been arrested
for molesting  boys and another had shot himself *end* Chip Bohlen seems to have been way above
scandals *end* Chip was very intelligent and very discreet *end* In addition to being very discreet and close
lipped the elite’s press and the System in general over the years have kept Chip Bohlen’s life a secret
from the public *end* Most men of Chip Bohien’s stature would appear in the Who’s Who in America *end* Not
Chip Bohlen *end* He has managed to keep to a very low profile thanks to the Illuminati’s control over all
types of information while remaining one of the most powerful men in the  century *end* Sen *end* McCarthy who was catching on to the Illuminati’s conspiracy tried to prevent Bohlen from being



approved as the U.S.’s "Ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary to the U.S.S.R." but on Mar *end*
&   the Senate gave him the important position *end* However Chip’s brother-in-law quit his
political career after being exposed by Sen *end* McCarthy *end* I had believed the lie of the press that
McCarthy was after communists but I read something the Senator wrote which showed that he was
out to expose a worldwide occult conspiracy--not simply communism *end* The work the Senator did is
continually referred to as a "witch hunt" but some day the witches he tried to protect America from
may well put this nation through another Holocaust and then the "witch hunt" of the Senator will
seem mild *end* Chip Bohlen also served as the no *end*  adviser for three Secretaries of State - James F *end* Byrnes George C *end* Marshall ’-’ and Christian Herter ’-’ *end* After graduating from Harvard
in the late s Chip worked for Frank B *end* Kellogg and Henry L *end* Stimson *end* The U.S *end* State
Department trained Chip to speak Russian several years before the U.S *end* had diplomatic ties with
Russia *end* When the U.S *end* put in an embassy in Moscow in  Chip helped open the first American
embassy in communist Russia *end* The American diplomats stayed at the Savoy Hotel in Moscow *end* The
Savoy Hotel in London has been used as an important Illuminati building *end*
Chip stayed in communist USSR until  when the U.S *end* government moved him to Tokyo to help
in Japan *end* According to Chip he and others were not surprised that Pearl Harbor took place because
there were strong indications that it was going to happen *end* See Chip’s book Witness To History pp *end* - *end* His book was edited by a fellow Illuminatus Phelps *end* After the attack on Pearl Harbor Chip
was placed under arrest by the Japanese *end* Then on June   Chip Keith Meyers head of
Standard Oil in Tokyo and some other Americans were put on board the Asama Maru and returned to
the United States via Portuguese East Africa *end* Chip Bohlen interpreted for Averell Harriman when
Harriman met the Russians for talks *end* Chip Bohlen did the interpreting and some advising of the
President when Roosevelt had his meetings with Stalin *end* Averell Harriman a member of the
Illuminati liked Chip and the work he did *end* If one looks at photographs of the Yalta and the Tehran
meetings between Stalin Churchill and Roosevelt you will see Chip Bohlen in the background *end* Chip
was also at the Potsdam Conference between Truman and Stalin *end* He was also in San Francisco as a
participant who helped create the United Nations in  *end* It was Bohlen and others who actually
wrote out the Marshall plan and then requested that Sec *end* of State George Marshall spell it out in a
speech at Harvard *end* It would take a long article to cover all the big meetings that Bohien participated
in *end* Needless to say he attended more big meetings involving global politics than any other American *end*
When Chip became the American Ambassador to the USSR the Russians trusted Chip enough to stop
their practice of having agents always follow the American Ambassador *end* Chip’s predecessors as
ambassadors had been George F *end* Kennen and Llewellyn E *end* Thompson *end* They had always been
followed by Russian agents *end* But things changed for Chip *end* By the way both Kennen and Dean
Acheson both were close friends with Chip *end* Chip was noted for his intelligence and candor by his
colleagues but the Establishment has kept the full story about him very much under wraps *end* Perhaps
only people like the CIA and intelligence personnel know the full story *end* For as powerful as Chip
Bohlen was he has been relegated to being in the shadows *end* When we look at the photos of the great
summit meetings Chip can be seen behind Stalin Churchill and the American Presidents *end* Francis
Hermana Bohlen -t was a famous lawyer politician and a teacher at Harvard from - *end* This is just one more of the famous Bohlen’s *end* This author waited until there was verification from
independent ex-Illuminati sources that Alfred Krupp his full name includes the title "von Bohlen und
Halsbach" had been a member of the Illuminati *end* There is no doubt that Chip Bohlen was part of the
Illuminati *end* As previously mentioned one of the Illuminati survivors I have worked with was alive
during W.W.II and has memories of how the Russians Germans and Americans in the Illuminati
kept working together even during W.W *end*  *end* A very close examination of what really went on behind
the scenes especially at the top shows that the parts of the Illuminati have continued to collaborate
together even during wars *end* The are many relatives of Krupp in Europe South America and the United
States *end* Arndt Krupp Alfred son who opted to become a professional playboy bought an estate in the
interior of Brazil *end* The estate covered  square miles had dwellings for  servants back in the
l’s-what’s happened in recent years I don’t know had a park modeled after Versailles and the
largest horse stables in Brazil *end* His private jet could carry his custom-built Rolls-Royce *end*


Important Illuminati rituals have taken place in Argentina and other South American locations where
Illuminati members from the U.S *end* and various European nations have flown in to participate in *end* As
more information comes in this author will be able to determine whether Arndt Krupp took part in
any of those South American Illuminati ceremonies *end* There are descendants of Hitler in several states
in the U.S *end* Because people move around there is no purpose in giving their locations at present *end* Of
course the controlled media would have us believe that Adolf Hitler who was very popular with
women during his life and a very powerful man at the height of his power did not have any
descendants *end* There were many German women who would have begged to have a child by him and
there were a number who did *end* There is no doubt in this author’s mind that the Krupp’s got ahold of
the Illuminati formula for creating multiple personalities who are programmed into Systems of Alters *end* The Krupp relatives have numerous castles and other pieces of property all over Germany and all
over the world in fact *end* I continue to get reports of Illuminati mind-control programming going on in
castles and Illuminati rituals taking place in German castles *end* It is a distinct possibility that castles tied
to the Krupp clan are being used for programming *end* Some of their castles and estates have been remote
and some have been left unused as far as the public was told *end* Summary *end* What we have learned is that
the Krupps have participated in the Illuminati and were primarily responsible for both Hitler coming
to power and for Germany rearming itself secretly in violation of the Versailles’ Treaty *end* We have
learned that Illuminati Kingpins like the Krupps are above the law and are usually above getting
themselves sincerely exposed in the controlled media *end* The Krupps provide an excellent example of
how a military build-up can be hidden and how scandalous behavior of the elite can go unpublicized
and unpunished *end* The same things are still happening today *end* We have learned about two Krupps who
wielded enormous power during the twentieth century Alfred Krupp and Chip Bohien *end* Alfred Krupp
was the most powerful man in European economic aflairs during his lifetime and Chip Bohlen who
was perhaps the most influential American diplomat of the twentieth century *end* We have gotten a
glimpse of how the remaining Krupps today are scattered and are to be expected to continue to play
an active role in the ritual life/& mind-control programming of the Illuminati *end*

How To Overthrow The Illuminati

By Will Chino Saudade and MaMoS

Introduction

Everyone talks about the Illuminati *end* You may have heard Jay Z and Beyonce
are members of  the Illuminati and channel demons when they perform *end* You
may have heard Obama is a member of  the Illuminati and plans to implant
microchips in all U.S *end* citizens to prepare for martial law *end* You may have heard
the dollar bill contains secret symbols which reveal the U.S *end* has been controlled
by the Illuminati for hundreds of  years *end*

Illuminati theory helps oppressed people to explain our experiences in the
hood *end* Society throws horrible stuff  in our faces our family members get locked
up for bullshit *end* Our friends kill each other over beefs money or turf *end* Our future
is full of  dead-end jobs that don’t pay shit *end* We struggle to pay bills while others
live in luxury *end* On TV we see people all over the world dying in poverty even
though we live in the most materially abundant society in history *end* Most people
act like none of  these terrible things are happening *end* Why does this occur *end* We
start looking for answers and Illuminati theory provides one *end*
We believe Illuminati theory is wrong and we wrote this pamphlet to offer
a different answer *end* We wrote this pamphlet because we know people who think
about the Illuminati usually want to stop oppression and exploitation *end* They’re
some  of   the  smartest  people  in  the  hood  today *end*  Forty  years  ago  Illuminati
theorists  would’ve  been  in  the  Black  Panther  Party *end*  Today  most  of   them  sit
around and talk endlessly about conspiracies *end* This is a waste of  talent *end* The world
is in a deep crisis and big protests rebellions and revolutions are happening *end* In
Egypt South Africa Turkey--and even in the U.S.--these movements are already
taking place *end* People who say we can’t do anything because no one else is fighting



are simply refusing to join the fight themselves *end* With the right tools we can
participate in these actions and make history with millions of  others *end*

This pamphlet is a tool to help you understand the world around you *end* It
offers a brief  history of  Illuminati theory who invented it when and where *end*
It  shows  how  Illuminati  theory  became  popular  in  the  hood  after  the  defeat
of  the movements of  the s *end* It reveals that Illuminati theory is unable to
explain  how  society  works  or  provide  solutions  for  how  to  end  oppression
and exploitation *end* It offers an alternative explanation of  why exploitation and
oppression exists and what we can do to change it *end* First we have to unearth the
origin of  Illuminati theory itself *end*

 *end* Where Illuminati Theory Came From

Almost every Illuminati theory is made up of  a few main pieces like the
different parts of  an urban legend *end* The pieces can be put together in different
combinations  or  one  piece  can  be  emphasized  more  than  another *end*  But  they
always combine to tell more or less the same story *end* You may have heard these
different pieces mentioned the Illuminati the Masons Satanists the Bilderbergs
or the bankers *end* Each of  these pieces of  Illuminati theory arose at different times
in history *end* In most cases they were developed by rich and powerful people who
were being kicked out of  power by mass movements *end*




First piece the Bavarian illuminati.. *end*
The  first  piece  of   Illuminati  theory  is  based  on  a  real  group  called  the
“Order of  Illuminists” *end* The Illuminists were founded in May  in Bavaria
part of  present-day Germany but Germany didn’t exist yet at the time *end* The
leader  of   the  Illuminists  a  Bavarian  professor  of   religious  law  named  Adam
Weishaupt wanted to free the world “from all established religious and political
authority” *end* His Order aimed to get rid of  the kings and the churches that had
ruled Europe since the Middle Ages and make
room for new forms of  commerce science and
democratic government that were struggling to
emerge  at  the  time *end*  The  Illuminists  modeled
themselves  partly  on  the  Jesuits  an  order  of
Catholic priests and partly on the Freemasons *end*
They infiltrated Masonic lodges in order to gain
influence in society and pursue their goals *end*
To understand any group or movement you
have to understand the context it emerged from *end*
The time period when the Illuminists appeared
was
a
century  of   ongoing  radical  change  in  Europe

called  “The  Enlightenment” *end*

It  was

adaM WeiShaupt -



stretching from the s to the late s *end* During the Enlightenment the old
social  system  that  people  had  lived  in  for  centuries  dominated  by  kings  and
priests on top with peasants at the bottom began to break down *end* A class of
rich merchants arose in Europe trading with far-flung parts of  the globe *end* New
technologies  developed  and  with  them  new  kinds  of   skilled  workers *end*  These
new classes started to wield more power than the kings and queens who were
supposed to be on top according to law and tradition *end* The American Revolution
demonstrated the power of  these classes to the whole world when they broke
free from the British crown *end*
As  the  social  world  began  to  change  people  began  to  think  differently *end*
Before  the  Enlightenment  most  people  believed  the  physical  world  and  the
social  order  were  determined  by  God’s  divine
law *end*  As  the  Enlightenment
set  in  experimenters  like  Isaac  Newton  and  philosophers  like  Hobbes  and
Rousseau  developed  modern  science  and  politics *end*  People  started  to  believe
the physical world was shaped by natural laws—like the law of  gravity—that
could be discovered by investigation *end* They described how governments could
be organized without kings through a social contract among “citizens” *end*

Soon hundreds of  small groups of  thinkers and activists caught the spirit of
the Enlightenment *end* The Order of  Illuminists was just one such group alongside
others  like  the  Rosicrucians  and  the  Italian  Carbonari *end*  During  the  s  the
Illuminists grew to about  members in central Europe *end* But they weren’t
very  successful  at  overturning  the  medieval  order  and  soon  began  facing
repression from authorities *end* They disbanded around  *end* Like so many other
groups of  its kind the Illuminists failed to bring about revolutionary changes *end*
But revolutionary change happened without them *end*
the

feudal

order

In  the  decade  after  the  collapse
of   the  Order  of   Illuminists  massive
protests  rocked  France  culminating
in  the  French  Revolution *end*  Rebellions
by angry peasants and urban workers
overturned
that
had  existed
for  centuries  and  sent
shockwaves  across  Europe *end*  Slaves  in
the  French  colony  of   Haiti  launched
their  own  revolution  demanding  the
same  freedoms  French  citizens  were
winning  on  the  streets  of   Paris *end*  In
France the aristocrats were kicked out
of
their  palaces  and  systematically
killed  so  that  no  king  could  ever  claim  the  throne  again *end*  Churches  were
burned  to  the  ground  and  Catholic  priests  driven  from  positions  of   power *end*
A  parliamentary  system  was  established  with  elections  representatives  and  a
legislature *end* It was the first time anything like it had happened in history *end*
the FrenCh revolution laSted

FroM  to



Not everyone celebrated the changes sweeping through Europe however *end*
People  whose  social  status  depended  on  the  old  aristocracy  and  the  church
tended to resist the changes *end* Some of  them wrote books and this is how the first
Illuminati conspiracy theories were created *end* In  an English scientist and
inventor named John Robinson wrote Proofs of  a Conspiracy against all the Religions
and Governments of  Europe carried on in the secret meetings of  Freemasons Illuminati
and Reading Societies *end* In  Jesuit priest Abbe Agustin Barruel wrote Memoirs
Illustrating the History of  Jacobinism *end* Both authors disliked the French Revolution
and so they blamed it on a small group of  conspirators the “Illuminati” *end*
  Robinson  and  Barruel  argued  that  the  Order  of   Illuminists  didn’t  really
disband  in    but  only  went  underground *end*  They  claimed  this  “Illuminati”
had secretly plotted and carried out the French Revolution and were still hiding
in Masonic lodges planning to overthrow governments in Europe and America *end*
Robinson and Barruel disliked revolution and they didn’t think it was possible
for millions of  people to mobilize together and change the conditions of  their
lives *end* To them ordinary people weren’t organized or smart enough to pull it off *end*
They needed to be guided like sheep by an elite group *end* In this way Robinson
and Barruel’s original Illuminati theory was a kind of  conservative myth used
to make sense of  a social reality its authors found confusing and scary *end* Today’s
Illuminati  theory  follows  the  same  pattern *end*  Even  poor  people  who  draw  on
Illuminati  theory  who  might  otherwise  sympathize  with  protest  movements
often view movements as secret ploys by the Illuminati to cause trouble *end*



...and the Freemasons

Robinson  and  Barruel’s  original  Illuminati  theory  and  Illuminati  theory
today talks a lot about the Masons *end* The original Order of  Illuminists established
itself  in Freemasonry groups called “lodges” *end* But Freemasonry had emerged a
few hundred years earlier *end* Originally Freemasonry was just what it sounds like
a  group  of   people  who  worked  with  masonry  and  stone  to  build  structures *end*
Starting in the s skilled workers such as masons weavers and blacksmiths
began to organize in groups called “guilds.” Guilds received permission to carry
out their trade in a given town and policed who could do their line of  work *end*
They were highly exclusive and invented rituals and symbolism to distinguish
themselves from everybody else *end*

As capitalism developed the guilds slowly broke down *end* New technologies
made their outdated tools and skills irrelevant and most disappeared *end* But the
Masonic lodges were different *end* In the s Masonic lodges began recruiting
rich or influential people in order to maintain their funds and high social status *end*
They soon lost their association with masonry work and turned into a social
club *end*
Masonic lodges provided a venue for radical organizing as the Enlightenment
set  in *end*  The  emerging  class  of   rich  merchants  and  intellectuals  gathered  in
Masonic  lodges  discussed  the  changes  taking  place  in  society  and  planned



activist  actions *end*  Many  famous  revolutionaries  developed  their  radical
ideas
while they were Freemasons *end* Because of  this association with Enlightenment
radicalism people who opposed revolution tended to view Freemasons as the
enemy *end* This is a common pattern the elite always think revolutions are planned
and directed by a small group of  enlightened people instead of  by masses of
people themselves *end*

In reality Masonic lodges are elaborate social clubs for people who want to
feel elite *end* In some places Masonic lodges have provided a place for intellectuals
to discuss how to change society but they’re usually pretty boring *end*  If  you go
into a Masonic temple today you’ll see groups of  small business owners talking
about  how  to  plant  trees  on  Main  Street  not  a  secret  group  plotting  to  rule
the world *end* Nevertheless their association with the original Bavarian Order of
Illuminists has meant they’re always included in Illuminati theory *end*

The Bavarian Illuminati and its association with Freemasonry is the first
piece of  the Illuminati theory we hear today *end* But there are two other important
pieces to most Illuminati theories anti-Semitism and the antichrist *end*



the second piece anti-semitism

Distrust prejudice and hatred toward Jews arose in Europe hundreds of
years ago *end* Europe was ruled by kingdoms allied with the Catholic Church after
the  collapse  of   the  Roman  Empire *end*  Jews  were  banned  from  playing  a  major
role  in  the  economy  or  gaining  political  power *end*  Over  time  different  Jewish
communities found ways to survive at the edges of  society doing things that
mainstream  society  looked  down  upon  like  lending  money *end*  Soon  Jews  as  a
whole  became  associated  with
this  profession *end*  At  first
this
profession wasn’t very powerful *end*
But
capitalism  developed
money-lending  credit  became
more important *end*

As

developed
millions  of   people  were  driven
off  the land and forced to work
for  poverty  wages  in  the  new
factories  of   industrial  Europe *end*
Because
already
identified with money and credit
different  groups  began  to  view
Jews  as  a  symbol  of   capitalism
itself *end* Many European workers believed Jews used their role as financiers to gain
power and exploit people *end* Jews also provided a convenient scapegoat for the
petit-bourgeoisie small business owners trying to become big-time factory owners *end*
This  class  resented  the  debts  they  had  to  take  out  in  order  to  expand  their

FaCtory Work in the induStrial revolution

WaS exhauSting and unSaFe like in Many

FaCtorieS around the World today



businesses *end* They viewed financiers as an obstacle to “fair” competition *end* In the
early  century Jewish communities regularly suffered attacks by mobs of
workers and petit-bourgeois business owners *end* Especially in Eastern Europe and
Russia “pogroms” lynch mobs against Jewish neighborhoods were a common
occurrence *end*
Anti-Semitism  united  poor  workers  with  small  business  owners  despite
their  opposed  interests *end*  The  poor  workers  were  angry  about  their  treatment
under capitalism but saw Jews as a bigger enemy than their exploiting factory
bosses *end* The small business owners worked to become the big-time exploiters of
the poor workers and felt Jews stood in the way of  their goals *end* These two classes
were fundamentally opposed to each other but temporarily joined together in a
populist movement because of  their mutual misguided anti-Semitism *end* Populist
movements  join  poor  people  with  the  petit-bourgeoisie  against  imagined  elite
enemies *end* They speak in the name of  the “common man” but they’re guided
by middle class elements and screw over poor and working participants in the
end *end*  Contemporary  examples  of   populism  include  the  Tea  Party  some  parts
of  Occupy Wall Street and the Nation of  Islam *end* Illuminati theories are often
populist in character *end* Many populist theories draw on anti-Semitism to identify
an evil elite that runs the world *end*
Many  Illuminati  theories  make  use  of   a  document  from  the  early  s
called  the  Protocols  of   the  Elders  of   Zion *end*  The  Protocols  claimed  to  be  a  secret
document written by Jews about their plans to take over the world *end* In fact they
were written sometime between  and  most likely by members of  the
Russian secret police *end* At the time Russian nationalists were trying to prevent
the  breakout  of   a  Russian  Revolution  against  the  Emperor  of   Russia  called
the Tsar *end* Most nationalists were strongly anti-Semitic *end* They viewed the entire
mass  movement  to  overthrow  the  Tsar  as  a  Jewish  conspiracy *end*  The  Protocols
were written to help fuel the movement against Jews in order they thought to
prevent the revolution *end*
Most  of   the  Protocols  was  crudely  copied  from  two  other  books  Dialogue
in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu written by Maurice Joly in  and
Biarritz a German novel written in  by Hermann Goedsche *end* Despite being
exposed  as  a  fake  the  document  became  widely  read  in  Russia  and  Europe
and eventually the U.S *end* too *end* Because of  this Illuminati theories regularly make
mention of  Jewish banking groups like the Rothschilds and the Bilderbergs and
portray Jews as a secret group intent on world domination *end* This is the second
major piece of  the Illuminati theory *end* The third is the antichrist *end*
the third piece the antichrist

Many Illuminati theorists also talk about the “end of  days” and the “mark
of  the beast” *end*  These terms come from a religious movement called Protestant
Millenarianism which arose in the mid s *end* Millenarian movements believe
the end of  the world is coming and try to get ready for it *end* Millenarians in the



s developed a complex timeline describing the Second Coming of  Christ
with a sequence of  important signs *end* One of  the signs was the coming of  the
“antichrist.”  In  the  Bible  the  “antichrist”  is  sometimes  described  as  a  single
person  and  sometimes  as  many  individuals  or  groups *end*  The  “antichrist”  is
supposed to gain dictatorial power over the world just before Christ’s return *end*
Today many U.S *end* evangelical Christians are constantly looking for signs that the
antichrist is appearing *end*
In the early  century World War One the Great Depression the rise
of   Fascism  and  World  War  Two  gave  Evangelicals  many  signs  that  the  end
was  drawing  near *end*  Based  on  their
interpretation  of   the  Bible  evangelicals
looked for signs of  growing government power and individuals with cult-like
status that might be the antichrist *end* In the s U.S *end* evangelical leader Gerald
Winrod  claimed  that  Mussolini  the  Italian
Fascist leader was actually the antichrist *end* He
said  the  League  of   Nations  was  a  sign  of
his  growing  world  power *end*  “End  of   days”
predictions continued for years afterward *end* In
the s some evangelicals predicted that
a new invention called the “computer” was
actually the antichrist *end* In the s others
argued that the microchip or laser barcodes
were  the  “mark  of   the  beast”  destined  to
brand  individuals  in  the  antichrist’s  name *end*
During  Obama’s
election  many  people
thought he was the antichrist *end*
The figure of  the antichrist and the “end

gerald Winrod -

of  days” has been a main piece of  many Illuminati theories since the s *end*
The story works like a game of  bingo believers have a list of  signs of  the end
of  the world and they sit around waiting for them to appear *end* Every popular
political  figure  like  Obama  can  be  seen  as  the  antichrist *end*  Every  big  political
organization like the U.N can be seen as his growing power *end* Every development
in information technology like implanted microchips can be seen as a “mark of
the beast.” Theories like these don’t accurately describe reality *end* Instead they get
people to find evidence for a theory they already want to believe *end*



the three pieces comBined = illuminati theory as We KnoW it

All the pieces we’ve talked about so far were combined in the s a time
of  great unrest *end* Before and after World War I there were huge working class
rebellions  against  capitalism *end*  Massive  workers’  movements  with  millions  of
members rocked Germany Italy France England and even the U.S *end* Workers
finally  toppled  the  Tsar  in  the  Russian  Revolution  of     and  they  tried
to  establish  a  communist  society *end*  To  many  people  it  seemed  like  a  wave  of
socialist revolution would overturn capitalism just as capitalism had overturned



feudalism a century before *end*
Just like before those who depended on the dominant order opposed the
revolutionary  movement *end*  They  felt  the  need  to  explain  the  growing  unrest
which they disliked and couldn’t understand *end* Just like the kings and queens in
the  French  Revolution  who  couldn’t  explain  the  uprisings  against  them  the
modern capitalists turned to Illuminati theories *end* They didn’t think workers were
smart enough to actually change the world *end* In  Nesta Webster an English
aristocrat published Secret Societies and Subversive Movements The Need for Fascism in
Great Britain *end* Lady Queenborough

Illuminati  more
than  before  now  the  Illuminati
were  said  to  be  descendants  of
the  ancient  Knights  Templar  and  every  secret  society  that  ever  existed  was
supposedly an Illuminati front group *end* They also linked Jewish financiers to the
Illuminati conspiracy *end* The Illuminati they said were paid by a secret group of
Jewish bankers in their quest for world domination *end* Webster and Queenborough’s
conspiracy  theories  were  preached  in  the  U.S *end*  by  Gerald  Winrod—the  same
Winrod  described  above  who  was  on  the  lookout  for  the  antichrist *end*  Winrod
wrote a pamphlet in  called Adam Weishaupt a Human Devil which drew
on Webster and Queenborough’s work *end* He argued that communism itself  was
a Jewish conspiracy and that the Illuminati conspiracy heralded the coming of
the antichrist *end*
Webster Queenborough and Winrod brought together the three pieces of
Illuminati theory under one big umbrella *end* Their writings established the main
core common to the Illuminati theories we hear today the Illuminati are a secret
society financed by a Jewish banking syndicate which goes way back to ancient
religious societies and which aims to rule the world *end* In some cases the Illuminati
are portrayed as followers of  Satan or the antichrist aiming to bring about his
rule on earth *end* Almost every Illuminati theory today builds off  this core story *end*

Originally  Illuminati  theories  were  used  by  elites  to  try  to  explain  and
stop movements *end* But if  these theories were first developed by elites and other
conservative forces how did they end up being used by poor and oppressed
people in the hood *end*



  *end* How Illuminati Theory Came to the Hood

Elites invented Illuminati theory to explain challenges to their power and
today  poor  and  working  class  people  in  the  hood  use  it  to  explain  our  own
oppression *end* We live in a society that blames individuals for failing to succeed *end*
But  people  in  the  hood  aren’t  stupid  we  know  we  aren’t  to  blame  and  that
there are outside forces preventing us from living with dignity *end* For this reason
conspiracy theories and urban legends have been a common feature of  oppressed
communities in the U.S especially black communities for decades *end*
In black neighborhoods people say AIDS was invented by the government
to kill off  black people *end* People say the government has secret plans to establish
martial law and open concentration camps *end* They say Church’s Fried Chicken
is secretly owned by the Klan which uses it to destroy black people’s health *end*
These small conspiracy theories and urban legends have floated around black
communities for years *end* It was only a matter of  time until the huge conspiracy
theories invented in the s put them together in one big Illuminati theory *end*
Without  meaning  to  the  black  liberation  movement  helped  this  to  happen *end*
Illuminati  theory  came  to  the  hood  after  the  defeat  of   the  black  liberation

like  the
Panthers identified the enemy as
white supremacist capitalism and aimed to unite workers of  all races against this
system *end*  Others like Ron Karenga the inventor of  Kwanzaa fell back on wrong
explanations  similar  to  Illuminati  theory *end*  They  saw  black  people  as  a  united
group regardless of  whether they were rich or poor and they thought all black
people were in a war against all white people *end* The Nation of  Islam invented
a  myth  of   black  superiority *end*  It  taught  its  followers  that  whites  were  created
thousands  of   years  ago  by  a  black  scientist  named  Yakub  in  a  lab  accident *end*



Now with the help of  the NOI blacks were out to regain their rightful place as
the superior race on earth *end* This story had no basis in science or history but it
provided one explanation for black oppression and who the enemy was *end*

Another part of  the black power movement turned to anti-Semitism *end* Many
black people saw small business owners exploiting black customers and banks
refusing to loan to blacks and some of  these people were Jews *end* In “Black Art”
the most famous poem of  the Black Arts movement Amiri Baraka wrote that
blacks needed “dagger poems in the slimy bellies / of  the owner-jews.” Louis
Farrakhan of  the Nation of  Islam also embraced anti-Semitic rhetoric at this
time *end*

These  black  artists  and  activists  mistook  the  immediate  appearance  of

their oppression for the whole thing *end* Yes black people were exploited by petit-
bourgeois  business  owners  and  bankers *end*    Yes  many  of   these  folks  but  not
all of  them were Jewish *end* But they exploited black people because they were
business owners not because of  their religion *end* Behind these individuals lay a
bigger  global  capitalist  system  which  exploited  black  people  too *end*  But  black
militants couldn’t put their finger on this so instead they blamed the bankers
and small shop owners who were in front of  their faces *end* Like in the s anti-
Semitism in the s served as a populist myth which hid class differences
within the black community *end* Poor and working class blacks could have united
and collaborated with other poor people to oppose the ruling class *end* They could
have fought the black business owners who who later became police chiefs and
mayors *end* Instead they united with black business owners and politicians against
a made-up “Jew” enemy *end*

developments were imprisoned or killed off *end* As a result younger generations
weren’t exposed to the idea of  class war between black workers and the black
and  white  ruling  class *end*  Other  black  revolutionaries  helped  black  politicians
run  for  office  or  became  academics  and  stopped  talking  about  revolution *end*
Internationally  the  national  liberation  movements  in  Africa  Asia  and  Latin
America  came  to  an  end *end*  The  theories  of   revolution  coming  from  these
struggles lost popularity *end* All this left a political void in poor and working class
black  communities *end*  Black  people  had  made  it  into  positions  of   political  and
economic power but racist oppression and exploitation continued for poor and
working class black people *end* How could one explain this reality *end*
Illuminati theory flowed in to fill this gap *end* It was similar to other conspiracy
theories that had been used before *end* It said the black elite had made it because
they were part of  a secret group of  rulers or had cut a deal with the devil *end* It said
poor and working class black people were still oppressed because these rulers
were super-powerful *end* And the trend deepened in the s *end*
illuminati theory in the “neW World order”

Illuminati  theory  resurged  all  over  the  U.S *end*  in  the  early  s *end*  Before
Russia collapsed and the Cold War ended most people felt big events could be
explained by the conflict between U.S *end* capitalism and Russian state socialism *end*
Every  national  liberation  struggle  in  the  Third  World  had  to  pick  between
these two sides *end* But everything changed with the end of  the Cold War and the
growth of  globalization *end* In  George Bush Sr *end* called the fall of  Russia and
victory of  the U.S *end* a “new world order” *end* This phrase was adopted by a variety of
conspiracy theorists as an umbrella term to link conspiracy theories together *end*
Conspiracy  theorists  began  to  publish  “superconspiracy”  theories  which
tied every existing conspiracy and urban legend to the Illuminati storyline *end* Some
of  these conspiracies involved UFOs Satanists or secret government plots to
colonize space *end* The most famous “superconspiracy” book is Behold a Pale Horse
written by William Cooper in  *end* Behold a Pale Horse brings together a huge
range of  different conspiracy theories in one big web including the Illuminati
Jewish bankers the Protocols of  the Elders of  Zion UFOs and more *end*
Many of  these theories were used by poor and working class whites *end* Whites
were  confused  and  angry  about  the  impoverishment  they  experienced  with
factory closings and globalization and the growing status of  non-whites in U.S *end*



society *end*  They  said  the  government  was  coming  with  silent  black  helicopters

murderous black gangs on the population *end* They said white gun-owning citizens
who were loyal to the U.S *end* Constitution would have to defend themselves *end* These
theories became very popular in groups like the Michigan Militia that appeared
in the s *end*

Some whites were clearly racist and opposed to the changes of  the s *end*
But others were experiencing increased oppression and exploitation as poor and
working class people and were angry about it *end* Just as black people in the s
blamed Jews for their oppression poor white people in the s blamed people
of  color--and the Illuminati--for their situation *end* In both cases the analysis of
these groups was incorrect and it
led them to fight the wrong enemy
instead of  building solidarity with
other poor and oppressed people *end*

of  apartheid Zulu nationalists met with the white supremacist AWB group to
discuss how to split the country into separate white and black nations *end*

The  overlap  between  these movements is  based  on  their  shared  populist
logic *end*  Both  white
supremacists  and  black  nationalists  believe  whites  are
fundamentally different from blacks *end* Both believe they need to separate from
each  other  given  certain  conditions *end*  White  supremacists  think  if   they  can’t
dominate blacks they might as well ship them back to Africa *end* Black nationalists
think if  white people won’t accept them they might as well form their own
separate nation *end*

Illuminati  theory  is  just  one  more  example  of   this  strange  overlap *end*  In
Illuminati  theories  poor  people  in  the  hood  see  banks  and  the  political  elite
as their enemy and they tend to embrace “black businesses” as a way to uplift

conservatives use Illuminati theory to target the same enemies as well as people
of  color and embrace the U.S *end* constitution as a way to unite with white political

Infowars *end*

just

Illuminati theory presents the same danger as white supremacist and black
nationalist theories *end* It will tend to support populist movements that unite poor
white people and poor black people with their respective ruling elites instead of
building a movement for the destruction of  white supremacy and the liberation
of  all poor and working people *end* Illuminati theory also presents a second danger
it simply fails to provide an accurate explanation of  oppression and resistance *end*


 *end* Why Illuminati Theory Doesn’t Work

There  are  several  logical  shortcomings  to  Illuminati  theory *end*  Here  are  six

main reasons that Illuminati theory isn’t a useful explanation of  the world *end*

 *end*  Illuminati  theory  sees  everything  as  connected  and  leaves  no  room  for  coincidences
or  mistakes *end*  Illuminati  theorists  tie  every  major  world  event  to  the  Illuminati *end*
They  believe  every  event  in  human  history  is  carefully  watched  planned  or
even controlled by conspiratorial groups *end* They leave no room for coincidence
Illuminati theorists believe everything happens for a reason that everything is
willed *end*

This view of  history ignores that a gap always exists between what individuals
or groups try to do and what ends up happening *end* This gap is a fact *end* It exists
for the rich and powerful just like everyone else *end* Even the U.S *end* government the
most powerful government in the world cannot stop dozens of  major events
every  year  from  natural  disasters  to  bureaucratic  screwups *end*  Of   course  some
great world events were led by important individuals or groups *end* There was the



Bolsheviks in the Russian revolution and the Black Panther Party in the black
liberation movement *end* But serious study shows that none of  these groups had an
all-powerful controlling influence *end* There are always contingencies coincidences
chance events and mistakes *end*
 *end* Illuminati theory makes the enemy out to be all-powerful *end* Because Illuminati theory
denies that history involves chance and mistakes it makes the Illuminati seem
god-like *end*  This  is  like  when  peasants  used  to  say  that  kings  were  untouchable
gods and could not be overthrown *end* The truth is there is no social group so
powerful that humanity cannot overthrow it *end* When the French revolution came
the king and queen were beheaded *end* In every period in history myths arise that
make the rulers seem invincible *end* With every transition to a new period these
myths are always shattered *end*

 *end* Illuminati theory fails to make basic logical or scientific arguments *end* When people
talk about Illuminati theories they vaguely suggest there is a connection between
groups and events rather than demonstrating exactly how they are connected *end*
For  example  an  Illuminati  theorist  might  say  “an  earthquake  happened  the
same day Obama made a speech using earthquake metaphors *end* This was not a
coincidence.”  The  Illuminati  theorist  hints  there  is  a  connection  but  doesn’t
say what it is *end* Did Obama cause the earthquake *end* Why was he trying to drop
hints about who caused it *end* They leave it up to your imagination *end* This lets the
Illuminati theorist avoid having to demonstrate and prove the connection he or
she is hinting at *end* Most of  the time if  the connection were described openly it
would seem silly or implausible *end*

Other  Illuminati  theories  offer  explanations  of   events  but  then  leap  to
saying their explanation is absolutely accurate *end* But just because an explanation
for something is possible doesn’t mean it’s probable *end* If  your car overheats and you
explain it by saying a bird built a nest in your radiator your explanation could be
accurate *end* But that doesn’t mean it’s the most likely explanation *end* For your theory
to become generally accepted you would have to show that other competing
theories are less likely or prove your theory true in practice by opening up your
radiator *end* Illuminati theory never does these things because it says we can never
get hard evidence of  the actions of  such a secret group *end*

In reality there is plenty of  evidence of  what the capitalist class does on
a daily basis *end* Most capitalist plans for economic and foreign policy are printed
openly in the pages of  the Economist and the Wall Street Journal *end*  We can see them
disagreeing publicly and we can see that sometimes their plans don’t work out *end*
Sure there are some secrets but as Wikileaks and Ed Snowden show even these
can be exposed by courageous people willing to take action *end* And most of  their
secrets are actually “open secrets” information is available in public libraries
and  websites  but  people  are  so  overwhelmed  by  the  volume  of   information
available that we don’t have time or energy to sort out what’s important *end*



 *end* Illuminati theory is impossible to disprove *end* Illuminati theorists have a clever way
of  attacking anyone who argues against them they say “that’s just what they want
you  to  think.”  Of   course  Illuminati  theorists never  ask  how  they’ve  avoided
being  tricked  themselves *end*  This  argument  is  a  trap  because  it  never  considers
any  evidence  trustworthy  and  so  it  doesn’t  allow  you  to  weigh  the  accuracy
or usefulness of  any theory *end* How do we know that all the conspiracy theories
on YouTube aren’t actually produced by the Illuminati *end* How do we know that
Illuminati theory itself  isn’t a government hoax designed to convince people
that  it’s  impossible  to  fight  back *end*
Or that Behold a Pale Horse isn’t an
Illuminati hoax *end* The logical traps
are  endless *end*  Once  you  go  down
this road you throw out any effort
to really understand the world or
weigh theories and evidence about
how it works *end*

people who invented Illuminati theory in the early s Illuminati theorists
today believe that the majority of  society are blind sheep who are incapable of
doing anything without being controlled by an elite *end* When the public doesn’t
react to their theories by rising up in rebellion they blame the public for being
stupid instead of  examining their own theories *end* Very often Illuminati theorists
think of  themselves as the only “enlightened” people and think everyone else
is below them *end* Many Illuminati theorists are just as elitist as the groups they
constantly theorize about *end*

 *end*  Illuminati  theory  offers  no  viable  solutions  to  the  problems  it  tries  to  explain *end*
Ultimately Illuminati theorists have no strategy no game plan no way out for
billions of  oppressed people on this planet *end* If  the enemy is all-powerful and
most people are duped then there’s nothing that can be done *end* All they can do
is constantly talk about conspiracies and complain that people are brainwashed
and will never wake up *end*

For example look at the revolutionary strategy offered by Illuminati The Cult
that Hijacked the World by Henry Makow *end* In the conclusion to this book Makow
offers tips for how to “survive the New World Order.” He tells us to “direct our
sex drive by confining it to a monogamous relationship.” What does this have to
do with fighting oppression and exploitation *end* He tells us to “escape the money



compulsion by living within our means.” Should we just accept the poverty that’s
imposed on us *end* He tells us to “defend your own soul” by engaging in spiritual
walks  and  meditation  outside  of   institutional  religion *end*  These  things  are  great
to do but they’re not going to end police brutality poverty or environmental
collapse *end*  And  he  tells  us  to  “ignore  the  crowd  which  is  manipulated  by  the
Illuminati.” Don’t sleep around be frugal pray alone and ignore everyone *end* This
strategy will never build a mass movement to change anything *end*
The logical shortcomings of  Illuminati theory are very convenient for many
of  its theorists *end* When it comes to fighting oppression they can talk about it but
they don’t have to be about it *end* What would these conspiracy theorists have said
to U.S *end* slaves  years ago *end* That the white slavemaster was all-powerful *end* That
he had duped the slaves into submission *end* That the slaves should stop having
sex be frugal pray and ignore the other slaves *end* They would have been the most
conservative and cowardly people *end* That is what many Illuminati theorists are
today sad as it is to say *end*
When  Illuminati  theorists  do  take  action  they  often  end  up  becoming
violent “lone wolf ” types like Timothy McVeigh the Oklahoma City bomber *end*
They think the enemy is super-powerful and so extreme measures are needed *end*
But they also think the masses of  people are stupid and so the “enlightened”
person can only act alone *end* This strategy never inspires masses of  people *end* The
lone  wolf   is  not  something  most  people  look  up  to  or  imitate  even  if   they
sympathize with his or her motivations *end* Ultimately “lone wolf ” actions are like
cries of  impotence *end*

The truth is masses of  ordinary people have the ability to change society *end*
History has shown it over and over again *end* Illuminati theorists are searching for
answers about why society is fucked up *end* If  masses of  people aren’t asking the
same question it’s not because they’re stupid it’s because they don’t think it’s
possible to change things and so don’t bother looking any deeper *end* Theories only
move people to action when they provide an accurate explanation of  the things
they are experiencing and offer viable ways for them to act to change things *end*
Illuminati theory offers neither *end*

Illuminati theory is inherently elitist conservative inaccurate and illogical *end*
Ultimately it is unable to explain oppression and exploitation or help us figure
out  how  to  stop  it *end*  To  truly  stop  oppression  and  exploitation  we  need  an
accurate analysis of  where they come from *end*
 *end* Where Oppression

and Exploitation Come From

The best way to explain oppression and exploitation is through a theory of
the capitalist system as a whole not Illuminati theory *end* A theory of  capitalism
explains  how  oppression
the  everyday

and  exploitation  happen  due

to



functioning of  a whole social system *end* The activities and interactions of  millions
of  people keep society running day after day and also create oppression and
exploitation in the process *end* By explaining how this system works we can figure
out how to stop it and create something new *end* We can also see how Illuminati
theory  fails  to  recognize  how  our  capitalist  social  system  works  and  instead
blames the bad shit we experience through on a single group of  people like
Masons Jews or bankers *end*
In  our  social  system  the  vast  majority  of   people  experience  alienation *end*
“Alienation” means the act of  separating something from oneself *end* When you go
to work for a boss you alienate your abilities to that person for the length of  your
shift *end* Your ability to lift boxes
do mental math or coordinate
an  office  are  all  properties  of
your body and mind *end* But for a
few hours they become a tool
for  someone  else  who  orders
them  around  for  their  benefit *end*
Your
alienated
to  serve  someone  else *end*  This
relationship  may  seem  simple
but  it  has  huge  consequences
when it happens to millions of
people every day *end*

In  our  capitalist  society  people  are  divided  into  two  main  classes *end*  The
vast majority alienate their labor their time their whole lives in order to get a
wage and survive *end* This class is called the proletariat *end* The proletariat includes the
workers who have to alienate their labor and everyone who depends on them
unemployed  people  children  the  disabled  and  more *end*  A  different  class  takes
control over the alienated skills of  the workers and the alienated products they
make *end* This class is called the bourgeoisie or the capitalist class *end* The bourgeoisie
uses the skills and products of  workers to their own benefit ultimately in order
to keep both classes in their respective positions *end*

As long as these class relations of  exploitation keep running day after day
the bourgeoisie will keep gaining more wealth and power by using the alienated
labor  of   the  proletariat  and  keep  strengthening  the  system  that  keeps  this
relationship in place *end* To end this situation we will have to do more than attack
individual members of  the bourgeoisie *end* We will have to attack the system of
capitalist social relations as a whole *end*
alienation our laBor taKen From us

Capitalism is a society built on alienated labor *end* At work we put our skills
to  work  for  someone  else *end*  We  manufacture  products  on  assembly  lines  but
when they come out of  the factory they don’t belong to us *end* We transport stacks



of   goods  in  trucks  and  warehouses  that  don’t  belong  to  us *end*  We  prepare  and
sell products that aren’t ours in restaurants and retail shops *end* Even when we’re
unemployed we’re surrounded by buildings clothes and food that don’t belong
to us which were alienated from people just like us when they were made *end* We
struggle to survive because we can’t take food clothing and shelter if  we need
them or share them if  we make them *end* Everything belongs to somebody else;
usually to a corporation *end* Capitalism is a society divided into one class of  people
who control others’ labor in order to make a profit and another class--most
of  us--who can only sell our ability to work in order to get food clothing and
shelter *end*

A byproduct of  all this alienation is that relations between people become
hidden  behind  our  relations  with  things *end*  Everything  in  your  apartment  was
manufactured transported assembled and sold by other people living a lot like
you your fellow proletarians *end* Those people rely on the things you make transport
or sell with your alienated labor too *end* But under capitalism we don’t provide each
other the things we make directly *end* Everything we make or transport assemble
cook is given to a corporation which ultimately sells it back to other alienated
workers like us *end* Instead of  relating to other people by freely sharing the fruits of
our labor we relate to things we have to buy and don’t see the working people
behind them *end* We become alienated from each other too *end*
reiFication our laBor turned into a thing

After a while we come to view this situation as normal *end* We come to think
of  ourselves as isolated individuals *end* Soon it starts to seem like products impose
their conditions on us *end* We are forced to go to
work  because  otherwise  we  can’t  get  things
like food clothing and shelter *end* We are forced
to  choose  careers  homes  and  even  spouses
based on their dollar values *end* We aren’t forced
to  do
things  at  gunpoint  but  our
options are limited because we don’t have free
access to the resources land tools and skills
necessary  to  sustain  ourselves *end*  These  things
were stolen from our ancestors and today if
we  don’t  work  we  starve *end*  If   we  don’t  make
smart economic decisions we end up poor *end*

We  end  up  justifying  these  relationships
as natural and justified when they aren’t *end* The

Relationship shapes all of  our choices that’s reification *end*

The side-effects of  alienation don’t stop with reification *end* In capitalist society
the process of  alienation also gives rise to ever greater oppression *end* Every time
workers  manufacture  something  transport  and  and  sell  it  they  make  money
for  the  bosses *end*  The  workers  who  do  the  alienated  labor  along  the  way  get  a
fraction of  the money back in the form of  a paycheck *end* But the vast majority
of   the  money  goes  to  the  bosses  who  then  use  it  to  hire  more  workers  to
manufacture transport and sell more products to make more money and so on *end*
Money that is used to make more money is called capital *end* Capital is our everyday
labor alienated from us and reified into a thing that dominates us *end*

capital our laBor turned against us

The more alienated labor we perform the more capital we generate *end* And
the more capital is produced the more power the people who wield capital have
to dominate us *end* Capital takes different forms *end* Sometimes bosses invest in big
office  towers  and  factories  and  capital  takes  the  form  of   physical  buildings *end*
Sometimes bosses use their capital to hire people to make sure the process of
making capital continues smoothly--for example managers or cops *end* In this case
capital  is  personified  in  other  human  beings  and  human  behaviors *end*  But  capital
itself   is  bigger  than  any  individual  cop  manager  or  boss *end*  A  corporation  can
change  its  CEO  or  board  of   directors  or  reshuffle  its  entire  workforce  and
the capital flowing through it can continue to grow *end* Individual corporations can
merge with each other or go out of  business and capital on a national scale will
continue growing *end* It’s like the Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy says rulers are like
bullets in a clip *end* As soon as you shoot one another pops up to take its place *end*

Capital is not just the capitalists who run the corporations *end* It is the whole
system the “game” with its own rules that everyone has to follow *end* So long as
labor is alienated from one class to another the day-do-day operation of  society
creates capital and with it a ruling class that takes control of  alienated labor
and products *end* Capital only grows by sucking our labor which it can do in many
ways *end* It can push us to work harder and faster *end* It can force us to work longer
hours or accept lower wages and benefits *end* Capital is nothing but our zombiefied
labor half  living and half  dead *end* It is nothing but our bodies and minds turned
into objects for use *end*

We produce and reproduce the capitalist system every day *end* Television and
toxic waste pornography and plantations silicon and slums nurseries and nukes
are all things it creates and recreates through our daily activity *end* Capital lives off
our energy it is vampire-like parasitic an alien force that dominates us from
inside of  ourselves *end* It reproduces itself  through us turning our creative powers



against us using our own bodies against ourselves *end*

Capital is not a conspiracy of  aliens *end* It’s an alien we create *end* It’s not just Jay
Z or George W *end* Bush--we have all sold our souls and our bodies to the devil *end*
But it is a devil we create with our own hands *end* It can do nothing without us our
bodies are its arms its legs its reproductive organs and its brains *end* Therefore
we have the power to end it *end* Throughout history poor and working people have
struggled to limit how much labor capital sucks from them *end* They’ve tried to
change the rules of  the game or stop playing it altogether *end*

no Way out But to destroy the system

Many  people  think  they  can  escape  the  cycle  of   alienation  reification
exploitation and oppression without overthrowing the system *end* Like “enlightened”
Illuminati theorists they think they can find an individual way out apart from
everyone else *end* But it never works *end* We can try to hustle on our own but we end
up working just as hard as for a boss and we risk getting locked up *end* Whether
we sell weed or bottled water we still have to compete with other hustlers or
make money for the suppliers above us *end* We can start our own business but we
still have to overwork ourselves to compete with other businesses *end* We can try to
get signed to a record label but we still make more profits for our bosses than
for ourselves *end*

Even  when  we  work  “for  ourselves”  our  labor  is  alienated *end*  We’re  still
wasting our talent creativity and time in order to survive and keeping the system
running *end* Sure one in a million may become the next Jay Z who runs their own
company *end* But this is only possible by exploiting thousands of  other people who
want to be Jay Z too and making sure they don’t make it *end* All these strategies
are  failed  routes  out  of   exploitation  and  oppression *end*  The  only  way  out  is  to
overthrow the system *end* This is possible because we create capital the very force
that dominates us *end* But Illuminati theory doesn’t recognize this fact *end* Instead of
viewing the system of  capitalist social relations as the enemy Illuminati takes
aim at particular groups of  people *end*
 *end* Where Illuminati Theorists Think

Oppression and Exploitation Come From

Capitalism is an elusive process *end* It exists in the billions of  social relations
between workers and capitalists and in millions of  physical objects but it can’t
be pinpointed in any one of  them *end* It’s a lot like gravity *end* Gravity can’t be identified
and touched but it can be felt in the relation between planets *end* Similarly you
can’t put your finger on capital in any one place but it is present in the relations
between people and asserts a powerful force on them *end* Illuminati theorists feel
this force at work in society but identify it incorrectly *end*



illuminati theory mistaKes Bad people For capital

Illuminati  theorists  look  around  and  accurately  perceive  aspects  of   the
capitalist system *end* But their explanation is wrong *end* Instead of  seeing capital as the
dominating force in society Illuminati theorists replace this with other forces
using  their  imagination *end*  Sometimes  Illuminati  theorists  project  the  power  of
capital onto particular groups of  people *end* As we’ve seen capital isn’t reducible
to any one individual boss manager or cop *end* But Illuminati theory projects this
huge power onto individuals who come to be seen as having all the power of
capital itself *end* Often Illuminati theorists mistake real people who serve important
roles in government or corporations for the force driving capitalism as a whole *end*
They view rulers as evil individuals who control everything instead of  powerful
figures who are still only players in “the game” *end*
decisions

that

to  have  a  say

Illuminati theorists imagine that the evil rulers are secretly planning how to
run the world *end* There is no doubt that many of  the places important decisions
happen--corporate  boardrooms  the  Fed  Reserve  or  the  Pentagon--are  not
democratic  and  transparent  institutions *end*  Illuminati  theorists  are  right  to  want
in
everyone
the
affect
their lives *end* But they don’t see
that as long as the capitalist
system  is  creating  powerful
people
corporations
democracy  will  never  really
exist *end* The vast majority of  us
can’t  participate  in  running
society every day because we
have to work for someone else to survive *end* Instead of  running society ourselves
we vote someone else into power to do it for us *end* This won’t end until capitalism
ends *end*
and

Illuminati theorists try to fight the enemies they imagine *end* They set out to
battle the Illuminati the Jews the United Nations or aliens *end* But all these are just
individual personifications of  capital or a projection of  capital onto made-up
groups *end* People who try to change the world using Illuminati theory are boxing
with shadows *end* The shadow is the shadow of  capital the real alien created by
all of  us through the social relationships we participate in every day *end* Illuminati
theorists blame a secret conspiracy that runs the world when they should blame
the system that recreates capital power exploitation and oppression *end*

illuminati theory mistaKes Bad ideas For capital

Conspiracy  theorists  often  emphasize  how  brainwashed  people  are *end*  This
shapes how they think liberation can be won or if  they think it’s possible at all *end*
We have a different take on people’s ideas *end* We believe people develop new ideas
through  a  complex  process *end*  Arguments  everyday  experiences that  clash  with



what we’ve been taught--and most importantly learning through struggle--allow
us to change our perspective *end*
There’s no doubt the power of  the media Fox News or Glenn Beck are
immense *end*  But  no  one  is  ever  a  passive  recipient  of   ideas *end*  Take  the  example
of   “rights” *end*  Our  society  teaches  that  everyone  has  equal  rights *end*  Everyone  is
smart enough to know it’s a lie *end* But still the idea seeps into their consciousness
and becomes part of  their common sense *end* This helps uphold the system *end* But
people can also use the same idea to challenge the system *end* They might demand
“rights” that the system wants to deny them like the Civil Rights movement
in  the  s *end*  Sometimes  these  struggles  reach  such  a  height  that  people
question the idea of  “rights” at all *end* This happened in the s when many
people  who  had  participated  in  the  Civil  Rights  movement  stopped  thinking
about winning rights from the government and started thinking about how to
overthrow the government *end* As you can see from this example the ideas people
are “brainwashed” with do limit their thinking but people aren’t entirely passive *end*
They also actively employ their ideas to understand their lives *end* And sometimes
their experiences in struggle change their ideas altogether *end*

According  to  most  Illuminati  theorists
people will only fight for liberation if  their
ideas  change *end*  The  most  effective  way
to
change people’s ideas they say is by talking
to  them  or  getting  them  to  read  or  watch
something that will “enlighten” them *end* These
methods  can  make  a  difference  on  a  small
scale *end* But this doesn’t happen so easily on a
larger scale involving thousands or millions
of  people *end* Yes we have access to the internet
blogs and YouTube and this helps us reach
more people *end* But a revolution is not going to
be made one YouTube video at a time *end*

of  struggle not simply by listening to what others have to say *end* As more and

Consciousness is changed by great historical events such as World War I and II
the Vietnam War the Russian revolution of   the economic crisis of

heads and develop new ideas *end* There is no magic trick to changing consciousness
no perfect conversation technique that will finally “enlighten” everyone at once *end*
The study of  how consciousness changes is ultimately the study of  history class
struggle and the ideas that are born in them *end*

Only by ending the forms of  oppression found in real life can we finally
get rid of  all the stories about aliens the Illuminati and other conspiracies *end* It
is the exploitation we endure every day as workers and unemployed people that
generates Illuminati theory *end* It is our alienation from each other and from our
most fundamental human capacity to create food clothing shelter art cities
etc which requires Illuminati theory as an explanation *end*

To destroy this imaginary world of  conspiracies we must destroy the real
world of  capital *end* The only way to stop this oppression and exploitation is to
to attack the way society is organized and destroy the social relation between
classes *end* To do this we will have to abolish classes entirely *end* We will have to kick the
bourgeoisie out of  power and create a new society where labor isn’t alienated
where workers control their work and where ordinary people control their own
lives and communities *end*

It’s possible to do this because capital needs us human labor is required to
keep the system going *end* Therefore we have the power to end capitalism *end* But to
do it we’ll have to do more than attack particular individuals who prop up the
system *end* We’ll have to attack the relations of  exploitation and oppression that
recreate capitalism *end* We’ll have to attack the system of  alienated labor and the
existence of  classes itself *end* The end of  conspiracy theories will come with the
end of  capitalism *end*

 *end* Liberation Beyond Illuminati Theory

Capitalism isn’t eternal it wasn’t decreed by god and it isn’t run by a secret
Illuminati *end* Like any social system it can be created and destroyed *end* As we’ve seen
capitalism depends upon our everyday activity to be sustained and reproduced *end*
Therefore  we  can  destroy  capitalism  by  organizing  with  each  other  to  stop
the process of  exploitation and oppression *end* By defeating the forces that stand
in our way *end* By creating new ways of  running society and living together with
dignity peace and with all of  our needs met *end*

In a truly free society everyone will labor for the common good without
being forced to work for a ruling class or pay for the goods produced by their
fellow human beings *end* Throughout the history of  capitalism the struggle for this
free society has been called anarchism or communism *end*



communism JailBreaK out oF capitalism

Communism is the movement of  the working class and the oppressed which
aims to overthrow the capitalist system and create a free society *end* For hundreds
of   years  poor  and  working  class  people  have  been  trying  to  end  capitalism

of  the oppressed to break their own chains *end* It can help us reach a better kind

Unfortunately many who called themselves communists throughout history
like those who call themselves Christians Muslims or Jews ended up practicing
something  very  different  from  what  they  preached *end*  Instead  of   fighting  for  a
free society where everyone makes what they can and shares what they need
many communists created dictatorships run by elites with the same alienation
and  exploitation  as  under  capitalism *end*  After  the  twentieth  century  the  names
Lenin Stalin and Mao are more associated with mass murder and oppression
than anything else *end* We agree with this assessment *end* At the same time we know
communism isn’t defined by these tragedies *end* Many anarchists and communists
throughout history fought against top-down state socialism and tried to find
a  different  path  to  liberation *end*  Like  them  we  believe  we  can  learn  from  the

Conclusion

In this pamphlet we’ve traced the origin of  Illuminati theory *end* It emerged in
the early s as a reaction to the revolutionary spirit of  the Enlightenment *end*
It  was  refined  in  the  s  in  reaction  to  another  revolutionary  wave  that
threatened capitalism itself *end* We’ve traced how these theories spread into poor
black  and  brown  communities  after  the  s  when  the  defeat  of   the  black
liberation movement left a political void in its wake *end*

We’ve offered a critique of  Illuminati theory *end* We’ve demonstrated that it
leaves no room for chance or error and so views the enemy as unbeatable *end* It
relies  on  circular  logic  and  innuendo  rather  than  logical  scientific  argument *end*
And it provides no clear strategy to end oppression and liberate humankind *end*

We’ve offered an alternative explanation of  capitalism which also explains
why Illuminati theory is so popular *end* Capitalism is an economic and social system
where one class of  people engages in alienated labor for the benefit of  another *end*
This everyday activity alienates us from each other and creates a reified power
that seems to impose itself  upon us *end* This power is called capital *end* It is bigger
than any one individual or institution who wields it *end* It is regenerated every day
by the activity of  millions of  people *end* Illuminati theorists sense this dynamic at
work but inaccurately project it onto individuals groups or made-up figures *end*

We’ve  argued  that  it’s  possible  to  overthrow  capitalism  and  bring  about
a  free  communist  society *end*  Communism  is  possible  because  capitalism  relies
on workers and must continually bring them together in cooperation in order
to  continue  sucking  their  labor *end*  This  cooperation  creates  the  possibility  for
revolutionary movements to change society *end* Communism is the movement of
people to overthrow capitalism throughout history *end* It is also the organizations
experiences  and  theory  that  have  been  developed  out  of   all  these  historical
experiences *end*

We  want  to  bring  together  talented  thinkers  and  fighters  who  yearn  for
liberation *end* We want to start a communist movement that eventually grows to
every city in the U.S *end* If  you agree with what we have written lets sit down and
figure out what we can do to end the oppression we see around us *end*

On the Trail of the Illuminati

 A Journalist's Search for the

“Conspiracy That Rules the World"

by George Johnson

copyright  *end* all rights reserved

originally published in Secrets of Angels and Demons

Many readers encounter the history and mythology of the Illuminati for the first time in the

course of reading Angels & Demons *end* They typically wonder if the Illuminati  is a real

organization in history and if so how much of Dan Brown’s description is accurate *end* To help

answer that question we turned to George Johnson the well-known New York Times science

writer *end* Johnson shares several interests with Dan Brown and fans of Angels & Demons He has

written extensively about the conflicts and confluences of science and religion including

contributing an essay on that topic elsewhere in this volume *end* He has written about quantum

physics and antimatter *end* And as it turns out he has written a book that deals extensively with the

Order of Illuminati its history and the uses of myths and legends about the strange organization

by mostly right-wing modern conspiracy theorists *end* That book Architects of Fear Conspiracy

Theories and Paranoia in American Politics was published in  and remains a veritable gold

mine of hard fact and analysis about the real history of the Illuminati *end* Even more important than

the factual history presented by Johnson is his description of the vast web of myth that has grown

up around the Illuminati and similar organizations of the past and present and the negative

political uses to which the myth is sometimes put *end*
For Secrets of Angels & Demons Johnson wrote a mini-memoir of the experiences more than

two decades ago which that  drew him into the Illuminati conspiracy theories and  political

paranoia and its impact on American politics *end*
Twenty years later the boxes are still stacked in my shed stuffed with pamphlets newspapers

books magazines cassette tapes even a few educational comic books all describing in numbing

detail the connections of a conspiracy as invisible and dense as the wiring on a computer chip *end*
The writers of these tracts include anti-Communists anti-Semites anti-Catholics anti-

Protestants anti-secular-humanists—so many things to be against *end* There are Christian

fundamentalists who believe they not the Jews are God's chosen people that America not

Palestine is the promised land; there are British Israelites who insist that the people of England

are the lost tribe of Israel; there are right-wing Catholics intent on overturning the Vatican II

reforms; there is an Orthodox rabbi condemning Reform Judaism as the source of all modern evil *end*
What all these tracts have in common is the belief that the world is in such a mess because of a

conspiracy *end* Never mind what you are told by the press *end* The events we see unfolding on the

television news shows and across the pages of newspapers and magazines are stage-managed

distractions a shadow play for children diversions to hide from us the true driving force of

history a centuries-old struggle for world control by a secret society called the Illuminati *end*
Egyptian sun worshipers and ancient Greek mystery cults; Gnostics Cathars Knights Templar

and other medieval heretics; mystical societies like the Spanish Alumbrados the "enlightened

ones" and the German Rosicrucians; European Freemasons the Communist party the Federal

Reserve the World Bank the Council on Foreign Relations and of course the Trilateral

Commission a kind of Rotary Club of the extremely rich and powerful—all have served as

"Illuminati fronts" in somebody's conspiracy theory *end* A picture is worth a thousand words and the

symbol of this group—an eye hovering above a pyramid—says it all a small elite of enlightened

beings sits at the top of the heap controlling all that happens below *end* They also control the money

supply hence the appearance of their emblem on the back of the one-dollar bill along with the

Illuminati motto Novus Ordo Seclorum *end* For that is the ultimate aim of the conspiracy a new

secular order *end*
I stumbled across the legend recycled yet again in novelist Dan Brown's Angels & Demons bits

and pieces also appear in The Da Vinci Code back in the early s when I was working as a

newspaper reporter in Minneapolis *end* A reader named Frank had been struck for all the wrong

reasons by an article I had written something about politics *end* He called and promised me the

biggest scoop of my life *end*
So on a very slow day anything to get out of the office I drove to the western suburb where

Frank lived by himself amid the acres of asphalt and shag carpeting that had replaced the

cornfields *end* He invited me into his modestly furnished living room offered me coffee and then

launched into an increasingly angry disquisition on the horrors of modern life wars famines the

rise of totalitarianism drugs crime venereal disease the gyrations of the stock market inflation

interest rates atheism—all were soaring beyond control *end* Then he posed his question

"Do you think all of this could be happening accidentally?"

The answer was in the hard glare of his eyes *end* Impossible *end* There had to be a master plan *end* Someone

was benefiting—the people at the top of the pyramid *end* The Illuminati *end* He asked me to pull a dollar

bill from my wallet and look at the back *end* Maybe he had a point *end* What was that weird shining

eyeball doing there *end*
Frank turned out to be right in an unexpected way this was the scoop of a lifetime *end* The story was

not that everything was controlled by something called the Illuminati but that all over the world

people like Frank fervently believed that it was *end* Where did this strange story come from and why

had I not heard it before *end*
I quit my job moved into the library and started my search *end*


They probably didn't mention this in your high school history class not I'm pretty sure because

of a nefarious cover-up but because of the relative obscurity of the event on the ninth of May in

 a prominent leader of New England's powerful Congregationalists the Reverend Jedidiah

Morse father to Samuel F *end* B *end* Morse inventor of the telegraph stood at the pulpit of the New

North Church in Boston and warned of a secret plot to destroy Christianity and overthrow the

newly formed government of the United States *end* Religion would be replaced with atheism faith in

God with faith in human reason *end* The name of this seditious force he declared was the Order of

the Illuminati *end* Hiding inside Masonic lodges—a secret society coiled inside a secret society—the

conspirators were waiting for the perfect time to strike *end*
The reverend's suspicions had become aroused by a book that had just been published and was in

its day as popular as a Dan Brown thriller is today *end* It was called in the unwieldy manner of the

time Proofs of a Conspiracy Against All the Religions and Governments of Europe Carried on

in the Secret Meetings of Freemasons Illuminati and Reading Societies by John Robison a

mathematician and professor of natural philosophy at the University of Edinburgh *end* As was clear

from the title he intended the book not as fiction but as an exposé *end* More accustomed to writing

about scientific subjects telescopes magnetism for publications like the Encyclopaedia

Britannica the professor had recently been shaken to hear that a secret society called the

Bavarian Illuminati had infiltrated the Masonic lodges in France and was responsible for

fomenting the bloody French Revolution *end* Far from a popular uprising of oppressed countrymen

Robison had concluded the revolution had been stage-managed by this group of puppeteers

conspirators bent on overthrowing the French monarchy and its ally the Catholic Church *end* Having

toppled this holy alliance the ancien régime the Illuminati were spreading across Europe and

possibly beyond *end* Their ultimate aim was world domination *end*
Reverend Morse had picked up his copy of Proofs of a Conspiracy in a Philadelphia bookshop *end*
Intently turning the pages he read how the plot had been hatched some two decades earlier in

Bavaria a principality in southeastern Germany by an atheistic young professor named Adam

Weishaupt *end* Hyped up on the ideas of Enlightenment philosophy—the superiority of reason over

religion; the equality of all men—his Order of the Illuminati tried to overthrow the Bavarian

government *end* The revolution failed and the group was disbanded or so the authorities believed *end* In

fact it had survived underground spreading like the flu through the Masonic lodges of Europe *end*
That was the story anyway *end* Robison was a Freemason himself—he considered it a harmless

diversion a social organization aimed at instilling the virtues of brotherhood and charity *end* He was

shocked to read what had been happening on the Continent *end*  Recently he warned the tentacles of

the Illuminati had reached into lodges in England Scotland and even the United States *end*
That was enough for Reverend Morse who immediately took to the pulpit to warn of "dark

conspiracies of the Illuminati against civil government and Christianity" emanating from an

"illuminated mother club in France." Everyone he said must read Robison *end* "We have reason to

tremble for the safety of our political as well as our religious ark."

Late-eighteenth-century New England was a land ripe for paranoia *end* Since the fall of the Bastille

in  Americans had watched in wonder and then horror as the French Revolution with its call

for a “reign of reason”—fraternity liberty and equality—had given way to the Reign of Terror *end*
In the churches statues of the saints were toppled replaced with depictions of atheist

philosophers like Voltaire *end* Priests noblemen and other dissenters were dispatched to the

guillotine *end*
Morse was terrified that the same sort of thing was about to happen in America *end* New England in

those days had its own milder form of church-state establishment the Standing Order consisting

of Morse's Congregationalists the upper-crust descendants of the Pilgrims and their political

allies the Federalists *end* With Napoleon's armies now marching across Europe President Adams

the leader of the Federalists feared that the United States would soon be the target of a French-

controlled insurrection an attack from within *end* Rallying to the threat Congress passed the Alien

and Sedition Acts reining in civil rights *end* Jefferson's Democrats were eyed suspiciously as French

sympathizers *end* Who knew *end* Maybe the Illuminati were behind the plan *end*
Even the wildest tales become easier to believe when they hit you from two different directions *end*
Around the time Robison's book appeared some local newspapers began excerpting the recently

translated writings "the ravings of a Bedlamite" Thomas Jefferson called them of a French

Jesuit Abbé Barruel who traced the Illuminati plot back to the medieval Cathars and Templars *end*
Before long his four-volume book on the Illuminati conspiracy was translated into English *end*
President Adams's wife Abigail considered the work must reading recommending it to friends *end*
Actually it turns out Robison and Barruel were cribbing from the same sources a mass of

pamphlets and articles that had been circulating in Germany and France portraying the eighteenth

century's various upheavals—political and ideological—as secret plots by a society of

"illuminated" men *end* Whether this inner light was sparked by impious philosophy or as some of

the tracts argued occult mystical powers seemed unimportant *end* Either way it was a black light of

pure evil *end*
It wasn't just the wackos who believed these things *end* In the midst of the hysteria the president of

Yale University Timothy Dwight warned the people of New Haven about the threat Shall we

my brethren become partakers of these sins *end* Shall we introduce them into our government our

schools our families *end* Shall our sons become the disciples of Voltaire and the dragoons of Marat;

or our daughters the concubines of the Illuminati?” His brother Theodore Dwight suggested in a

public speech that Jefferson himself might be an Illuminatus *end* Reverend Morse listed Thomas

Paine as a coconspirator *end*
When he took to the pulpit the following year he was ready to name names "I have now in my

possession complete and indubitable proof  *end*  *end*  *end* an official authenticated list of the names ages

places of nativity possessions of the officers and members of a Society of Illuminati  *end*  *end*  *end* "

It is impossible now to read these words without thinking of a later demagogue the Red-baiting

Senator Joe McCarthy as he spoke in  of another nefarious plot "I have here in my hand a

list of  members of the Communist party  *end*  *end* ."

Morse's evidence was as flimsy as McCarthy's the names of some one hundred Virginians—

mostly French immigrants—who belonged to a Masonic lodge with ties to one in France *end*  Who

knew what kind of radical ideas might be fermenting inside those walls *end* To Morse and other

leaders of the Standing Order the secular ideals of Enlightenment philosophy seemed as

threatening as Communism would  years later *end* And France in the grip of an ideology its

armies marching across Europe had all the makings of an evil empire *end*


The human race has blundered on as long as it has because our brains have evolved into precision

instruments for seeing order in the world even when it isn't there *end* As I read about the New

England Illuminati scare—the primary source is Vernon Stauffer's  history New England

and the Bavarian Illuminati—and about the confusing role of Freemasonry in the French

Revolution I felt the neuronal hum of ideas clicking together to form a structure *end* It's a seductive

feeling—that everything is connected that this mad mad world can be embraced by a single

theory of everything  a tight network of cause and effect with a prime mover in control  *end*  *end*  *end* that

there is a secret history in which everything you know turns out to be wrong *end*
Individually the facts check out *end* There was indeed a struggle in the eighteenth century between

the Catholic Church and Freemasonry whose secretive lodges served in those days as safe houses

for gentlemen interested in new ideas—science philosophy politics a cosmopolitan government

a secular society a brotherhood of man extending across the boundaries of nations *end* Amid the

claptrap of secret rituals and ceremonies dangerous ideas were being entertained *end*
Some of these "free thinkers" as they were called naturally became involved in the French

Revolution *end* A few pursued more dubious interests spiritualism mesmerism the cabala alchemy *end*
There was a thin line then between hardcore science and what we now dismiss as the occult *end* If all

that seems hard to reconcile with Masonry today—conservative middle-aged businessmen raising

money for charity and marching in patriotic parades—then remember these were tumultuous

times *end* The world was in upheaval everything was up for grabs *end*
Whether or not as legend has it this unlikely consortium descended from traveling guilds of

ancient stonecutters is a mystery *end* In any case operative masonry—the real kind involving

hammers and chisels and flying chips of rock—provided the inspiration for speculative Masonry

just as a rock can be shaped to fit sturdily within a wall so can a man be shaped into a better

citizen not just of the country but of the world *end*
Those who felt threatened by the phenomenon had no tools for understanding it except as a

conspiracy *end* Add in the spurious myths that Masons had concocted about themselves—that they

inherited their traditions from the builders of the pyramids and biblical stonecutters that their

rituals have been protected for centuries by secret societies  this is where the Cathars Templars

Rosicrucians and so forth come in and it all makes for a tantalizing tale *end* Each of these groups

had at one time or another been branded by the church as heretics dabblers in the occult;  some

had been dragged before the Inquisition *end* Spice up the tale with some of the Vatican propaganda

that had been floating around for centuries and you had yourself a conspiracy theory the history

of the European Enlightenment stripped of its subtleties and contradictions milled and hammered

into rectilinear form *end*
Swept along by the intellectual free-for-all an idealistic and somewhat megalomaniacal

professor—the real Adam Weishaupt—started his Order of the Illuminati on May   *end*
Conspiracy theorists just love this date May Day when the Communist Internationale is

celebrated grafted onto the birth year of the  U.S.A *end* Weishaupt wasn't the first to use the

Illuminati name *end* Long before a mystical society called the Alumbrados Spanish for

"Illuminati" had been targets of the Inquisition *end* There is no evidence that the Bavarian order

shared anything with the Spanish Alumbrados except the name *end* But to the paranoiacs there had

to be a connection *end*
Viewed from the twenty-first century Weishaupt's aims sound noble enough to smuggle

philosophy books—Voltaire Diderot D'Alembert Montesquieu—past the Jesuits who ran the

Bavarian school system and to arm a generation of scholars intellectually against the

repressiveness of a country paralyzed by dogma *end*
Weishaupt however was not the man for the job *end* It is human nature perhaps for one to take on

the worst qualities of his enemies *end* The Jesuits the soldiers of the Vatican were known partly

through their actions and partly through Protestant propaganda for their wiliness as the pope's

CIA *end* So ingrained is this image that the second definition of jesuit in Merriam-Webster is "one

given to intrigue or equivocation." Maybe Weishaupt felt that he was up against so formidable an

opponent that he had to fight it on its own terms *end* In any case his first order of business was to

invent an array of secret rituals and codes that gave his new Illuminati the appearance of a cult of

reason *end* Members in the lowest ranks were not allowed to know even the identities of their fellow

initiates much less that of their highest superiors *end* They were required to spy on each other and

write intelligence reports *end* Sometimes Weishaupt comes off as an eighteenth-century Bavarian

version of Lyndon LaRouche *end*
This weird combination of scholarship and skullduggery apparently had an appeal *end* The more

illustrious members included Goethe the German poet and natural philosopher and the author of

Faust *end*  The movement spread throughout universities and Masonic lodges in Germany and

Austria becoming influential enough to engender a high degree of paranoia among keepers of the

status quo *end* It was not a violent revolution Weishaupt and his acolytes were hoping to foment but

an intellectual one *end* Thomas Jefferson probably had it right when he later wrote

"As Weishaupt lived under the tyranny of a despot and priests he knew that caution was

necessary even in spreading information and the principles of pure morality  *end*  *end*  *end* This has

given an air of mystery to his views  *end*  *end*  *end* and is the color for the ravings against him of

Robison Barruel and Morse."

In the end the church and the royalty easily triumphed *end* Responding to all kinds of fantastic

accusations the government quashed Weishaupt's order less than a decade after it was founded *end*
The Illuminati conspiracy such as it was ended *end* And the Illuminati conspiracy theory had begun *end*


I still remember the evening in  when I drove my rental car to the Los Angeles suburb of

Van Nuys to hear a talk called "Adam Weishaupt a Human Devil." I'd finished the library

research for my book and was now on a fact-finding mission in the land of paranoia southern

California *end* Outside the meeting room people sat at card tables selling tracts about the great

conspiracy Secret Societies and Subversive Movements published in ;  None Dare Call It

Conspiracy a classic of right-wing paranoia from the s; a booklet called “The Cult of the

All-Seeing Eye.” There was even an edition for sale of Robison's Proofs of a Conspiracy

reprinted by the John Birch Society with a new introduction pointing out the parallels between the

Illuminati and the Communist party *end*
For the next hour the speaker an electronics engineer for an aerospace company laid out the

twentieth-century version of the Illuminati legend *end* By now the tale had taken on a fundamentalist

Christian flavor *end* The original Illuminatus was Lucifer himself—of course *end* the angel of

light—and the mischief began in the Garden of Eden when Eve was tempted by the serpent and

mankind fell from grace *end* From there the satanic plot was carried forth by the usual chain of cults

secret societies and European philosophers culminating in the Bavarian Illuminati staring at us

insolently from the back of our own dollar bills *end* Light Lucifer Enlightenment Illuminati– the

words rang with a sonorous resonance *end* Maybe the deepest of mysteries is how ideas and images

these memes as some scientists now call them take on a life of their own *end* We are just the

vectors disposable receptacles brains equipped with arms and legs for spreading the infection

around *end*
From Van Nuys I drove to Rancho Cucamonga—what a perfect name for this town!—where I

met Alberto Rivera a disturbed little man who claimed to be a former Jesuit priest *end* He had left

the church in horror when he learned that it was actually controlled by the Illuminati *end* Now here

was a curious twist a legend started by paranoid priests had mutated into anti-Catholic

propaganda *end*  The conspiracy theory had come full circle *end* The details were all there in a lurid

Christian comic book Alberto part of a series in which the Catholic Church invented by Lucifer

and descended from pagan worship uses occult powers to secretly control the world *end* The Vatican

had fomented the Bolshevik Revolution it had recruited Hitler to exterminate the Jews *end*
This was all becoming drearily familiar by now as was the version of the tale in which the Jews

are the Illuminati with the plan for world domination laid out in The Protocols of the Meetings of

the Elders of Zion *end*  Was the Christian ecumenical movement a Catholic-Illuminati plot to

subsume Protestantism Alberto Rivera again or a Protestant-Illuminati plot to undermine

Catholicism as in Conspiracy Against God and Man by Father Clarence Kelly *end* Take your pick *end*
I'd read in The Occult and the Third Reich by the pseudonymous Jean-Michel Angebert how the

Nazis were an Illuminati front and in To Eliminate the Opiate by Rabbi Marvin S *end* Antelman

how the Illuminati were Reform Jews *end*
Everyone was part of the conspiracy *end*


It turns out that there is a perfectly innocuous reason for the staring pyramid on the dollar bill *end*
The very same symbol appears on the back of the Great Seal of the United States as adopted by

the Continental Congress in  *end* On the front is the familiar eagle with E Pluribus Unum

dangling from its beak *end* Egyptology was all the rage back then—a pyramid already appeared on

the Continental fifty-dollar bill *end* When he designed the Great Seal Charles Thomson adopted a

similar image to signify strength and duration *end* The eye he explained was that of Providence

looking benevolently over the new nation *end* Novus ordo seclorum is Latin for "a new order of the

ages" referring Thomson said to "the new American era."

A century and a half later Henry Wallace a member of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's cabinet

suggested with a bit of a stretch that the motto could also be taken to mean "the New Deal."

Roosevelt liked the idea and had the whole seal front and back emblazoned on the dollar *end*
As it happens Masons do count both FDR and Wallace among their illustrious past members

along with George Washington Benjamin Franklin James Monroe James Buchanan Andrew

Johnson Theodore Roosevelt William Taft Warren G *end* Harding Lyndon Johnson and Gerald

Ford—and for that matter Davy Crockett Buffalo Bill Douglas Fairbanks and  John Wayne *end*
Such are the coincidences that serve as the glue for conspiracy theories—and for Dan Brown

thrillers *end* Other novelists have also cashed in on the myth Robert Anton Wilson in his whimsical

Illuminatus *end* trilogy and Umberto Eco in his intellectual bestseller Foucault's Pendulum *end* Both

works were written tongue in cheek with a high sense of irony *end* With his more low-brow

approach Brown has brought the Illuminati thoroughly into the mainstream *end* Like the good

Reverend Morse we live in paranoid times *end*
In concocting his version Brown takes even greater leaps than John Robison and Abbé Barruel *end*
The most illustrious Illuminatus in Angels & Demons Galileo had in fact been dead for

years when the Bavarian order began *end* There are other possible connections *end* During Galileo's

lifetime Alumbrados were skulking around *end* Like the fictional Illuminati in the novel they were

indeed enemies of the Vatican *end* But their brand of mystical illumination would hardly have

appealed to a scientist *end*
If I wanted to weave Galileo into a conspiracy theory I think I would make him a Rosicrucian *end* In

The Rosicrucian Enlightenment the Renaissance scholar Frances Yates speculated that this secret

society similar to the Masons in its grab bag of beliefs was a precursor to the Royal Society

which was to emerge as the most prestigious scientific organization in the world *end*
Then I'd connect the Rosicrucians to the Alumbrados and the Alumbrados to the Illuminati *end* The

whole structure is lying there waiting to be twisted like a pretzel into all kinds of fantastic shapes *end*


When my book Architects of Fear Conspiracy Theories and Paranoia in American Politics was

published in  it made barely a ripple in the infosphere selling some three thousand copies

before disappearing from the face of the earth *end* During a call-in radio show in Los Angeles a

member of the John Birch Society Gary Allen the guy who wrote None Dare Call It

Conspiracy told me I was a purveyor of "accident theory"—the naive belief that sometimes

things just happen that there is a fair amount of randomness in life *end* After winning a minor

literary award I'd pretty much forgotten about the book until a few years later when it was

translated into Japanese *end*
I suspected something was wrong the moment I saw the cover The legendary eye in the pyramid

looking sternly ominously not at all providentially out over the skyline of Wall Street with a

flurry of American dollars spreading everywhere *end* On the back was a photograph of a very nerdy

Japanese man wearing a beret and large-framed glasses *end* Who was this person and what had he

done to my book *end*
By then I was living in New York and working for the New York Times *end*  Drawing on a

colleague's advice I hired a Japanese music student at Juilliard to translate the translation *end* The

title was now The World of Illuminati That Exceeds That of the Jews *end* The subtitle The Power

Organization That Rules the World *end* On the bottom of the cover were the words "The Top

Conspiracy Organization Revealed for the First Time *end* What Is the Illuminati! *end* And What About

Japan?"

In a new forward the man in the beret had put forth his own conspiracy theory a complex tale in

which the Illuminati plotted World War II as part of a plan to subvert his country's economy *end*  "In

spite of the author's zealous protests" he wrote "I am inclined to believe that Illuminati have the

power to control the Western society as one great intellectual economic and political power." A

translator's afterward suggests that my book may actually be Illuminati disinformation—part of a

conspiracy to deny the conspiracy *end*
With some legal help I was eventually able to get the book removed from the marketplace *end* I

learned that this transmogrified version had sold far more copies than the original American

edition *end* Promoting conspiracy theories turns out to be much more profitable than debunking

them another reason this mania will never go away *end*

the  whole  world  will  be  deceived

     In the last book of the Bible Jesus Christ gives His Last warning before He returns the
second time *end* This Last Day warning is found in chapters     &  of the Book of
Revelation *end*  Jesus  warns  His  people  about  how
into
worshipping Satan symbolized as the Seven Headed Dragon attacking a woman a symbol of
the True Faith *end*
     In Revelation    Jesus' prediction about the worship of Satan throughout this world
may be read "And they WORSHIPPED THE DRAGON which gave power unto the beast
and they worshipped the beast saying Who is like unto the beast *end* Who is able to make war
with him *end* .. *end* And all that dwell upon the earth SHALL WORSHIP HIM WHOSE NAMES
ARE  NOT  WRITTEN  IN  THE  BOOK  OF  LIFE  OF  THE  LAMB  SLAIN  FROM  THE
FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD *end* If any man have an ear let him hear."
       The  Apostle  John  wrote  "Little  children  it  is  the  last  time  and  as  ye  have  heard  that
antichrist shall come even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last
time." .John  *end*
     The Apostle Paul warned "Let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not
come  except  there  come  a  falling  away  first  and  that  man  of  sin  be  revealed  the  son  of
perdition;  Who  opposeth  and  exalteth  himself  above  all
is
worshipped so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God shewing himself that he is God."
.Thessalonians   *end*  There  are  various  ways  our  Lord  has  made  known  to  His  followers
how  to  detect  Satan  who  is  the  invisible  head  of  a  partly  religious  and  partly  political
movement *end* Revelation  warns it would be branded with the number  *end* In Revelation
  our  Lord  describes  this  satanic  movement  that  is  antichrist  in  a  symbol  of  a  lewd
beautiful woman *end* And upon her forehead was a name written "MYSTERY BABYLON THE
GREAT MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH."
     The very last warning our Lord is now giving the deceived world is found in Revelation
 *end* "And I heard another voice from heaven saying COME OUT OF HER MY PEOPLE
THAT  YE  BE  NOT  PARTAKERS  OF  HER  SINS  AND  THAT  YE  RECEIVE  NOT  OF
HER PLAGUES."
     There are three distinct messages symbolized as three angels in Revelation  *end* Revelation
  is calling the world away from the worship of the Dragon to worship God who created
the  heaven  earth  and  the  sea  and  the  fountains  of  waters *end*  In  Revelation    it  tells  how
Babylon the Great is fallen and how she has made all nations to drink of the wine of the wrath
of  her  fornication *end*  However  in  Revelation    we  read  the  most  solemn  warning  ever
given to the world of which most are completely ignorant *end* Satan is hardly ever mentioned in
many Christian circles much less how he is predicted in Scripture to lead most to lose their

that

is  called  God  or

salvation *end*
     "And the third angel followed them saying with a loud voice If any man worship the beast
and his image and receive his MARK in his forehead or in his hand the same shall drink of
the  wine  of  the  wrath  of  God  which  is  poured  out  without  mixture  into  the  cup  of  his
indignation;  and  he  shall  be  tormented  with  fire  and  brimstone  in  the  presence  of  the  holy
angels and in the presence of the Lamb." Revelation  *end*
       God  reveals  that  all  nations  have  already  been  deceived  by  "Babylon  the  Great  The
Mother of  Harlots and Abominations of the Earth." And our Lord is calling His people out of
Babylon *end*  But  the  question  to  most  is  what  is  Babylon *end*  This  is  the  whole  purpose  of  this
book *end* It is to lay wide open for all to see what the sins of Babylon the Great are and who she
is  and  who  this  mysterious  scarlet  colored  beast  is  that  she  is  riding  on  as  described  in
Revelation - *end*
     While we study the history and the nature of  "Babylon the Great and of the Beast that is
carrying  her"  we  will  learn  that  there  was  is  and  always  shall  be  in  this  world  avowed
worshippers of Lucifer *end* Some will be shocked to learn that Luciferians have lived and died in
promoting the worship of Lucifer through Babylonian Egyptian and Druid Witchcraft and
are determined to overthrow all religions and governments *end* Their goal is to unite the world
into a One World Government and exalt Lucifer as the only god of this world *end*
     As we continue to study the nature of "Babylon the Great" we will study the philosophies
of "Wicca" Wicca is the modern version of Babylonian Egyptian and Druid Witchcraft with
millions of both male and female members *end* We will learn how apostles of Lucifer in the past
and present are using Secret Societies Communism International Banking Christian fronts
social  issues  to  further  their  plans *end*  We  will  learn  how  these  modern  day  witches  are  ever
determined  to  overthrow  the  worship  of  Jesus  Christ  and  Christianity  by  using  subliminal
warfare Mind Sciences and physical force *end* This Luciferian plot to destroy all religions and
all governments so that a One World Luciferian Government may be established is coming
today in what is known as "The Aquarian Age" or "The New Age Movement." In Latin it is
called Novus Ordo Seclorum New Order for the Ages *end* But its real concealed name is The
Illuminati *end*  And  it  will  be  shown  that  it  was  from  the  Secret  Order  of  The  Illuminati  that
Communism was derived *end*
     We will study the origin of the number  and who today is branded with it *end* We will
study the Mark of the Beast with whom no true follower of Jesus will identify *end* We will take a
journey through documentive history starting with Lucifer's rebellion in Heaven and continue
to expose through history how Lucifer was worshipped both ignorantly and openly through
the  astrological  systems  of  Sun  worship *end*  After  the  camouflages  have  been  removed  from
paganism that reveal it was in reality Satan who was worshipped as the Sun-god then we shall
remove  all
Christianity and through an international political movement for a One World Government *end*

the
Bottomless Pit will be carefully studied and understood later on in the book *end* However before
the ordinary reader can comprehend any of these things we must go back into history to the
time of Adam and Eve and to the time of Noah and Nimrod *end*
       The  origin  of  lies  traces  to  Lucifer  Genesis   *end*  And  the  origin  of  false  religion  also
began with Lucifer *end* In Isaiah - we read
     "How art thou fallen from heaven O Lucifer son of the morning *end* How art thou cut down
to the ground which didst weaken the nations *end* For thou hast said in thine heart I will ascend
into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the mount of the
congregation in the sides of the north I will ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be
like the most High *end* Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit."
     It has been Lucifer's plan from ancient times to gradually unite this entire world into a One
World Government that would reject its Creator and worship Lucifer instead *end*

through

   Lucifer  sowed  seeds  of  murmuring  complaining  and  strife  which  germinated

     Lucifer before his fall was the most exalted angel next to Christ *end* The "son of the morning"
stood  in  the  presence  of  God  with  Christ *end*  He  was  the  covering  Cherub  the  lightbearer  for
God *end* However Lucifer began to think of himself as equal in splendor and wisdom to God *end* He
began to think he also deserved worship from the Lord's servants and began to plot against
the Lord of Heaven *end* Lucifer the covering Cherub did set his face to overthrow the worship of
God *end* Lucifer did not at once reveal his covetousness *end* If he had exposed all of his plans to the
Universe  where  sin  and  rebellion  at  that  time  were  not  known  he  would  not  have  gained
much following *end* Lucifer's plot to overthrow the government of Heaven would take long and
careful planning *end* Little by little Lucifer began to find others whose sympathy he could gain
by criticizing how the Lord managed the affairs of the Universe *end* Lucifer tried to make the
God of Love the Lord of the Sabbath appear to be a selfish tyrant *end* Lucifer assuming the
guise of godliness led many Heavenly Beings to come over to his side by misrepresenting
God's character as if God Himself were the Evil One *end*
into

rebellion and caused divisions among the angels of Heaven *end* Lucifer tried to weaken the unity
of Heaven thinking this would weaken the power of the Almighty *end* However only one third
of the Heavenly host chose the side of the god of confusion *end* The whole Universe chose only
two sides; there was no middle ground *end* There was war in Heaven between Christ and Lucifer *end* "And  the  great  dragon  was  cast  out  that  old  serpent  called  the  Devil  and  Satan  which
deceiveth the whole world He was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with
him." Revelation  *end*
     The very plans Lucifer tried to execute in Heaven he is now conditioning the people of the
world to accept *end* Just as Satan or Lucifer concealed his real plans from the angels in Heaven
in the beginning to overthrow the worship of God so is Lucifer trying today to overthrow the
True  worship  of  God  among  the  inhabitants  of  this  world *end*  Just  as  Satan  did  not  suddenly
expose his real plans that would have demanded the worship of him by Heavenly Beings so
has Satan camouflaged the worship of himself among earthly beings through a world-wide
network of gods and goddesses and later through false systems of Christianity *end*
the  Old

Testament *end*  It  was
the  worship  of  Lucifer  was  camouflaged
throughout this world *end* Those who obeyed the pagan precepts were actually bowing their knee
before the Devil not gods as they thought *end* "Know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves
servants  to  obey  his  servants  ye  are  to  whom  ye  obey;  whether  of  sin  unto  death  or  of
obedience unto righteousness?" Romans  *end*
     As the angels of Heaven chose sides before Lucifer was cast out of heaven so will the
people  of  this  world  join  into  two  distinct  groups  before  the  end  of  this  age *end*  The  line  of
distinction which will be studied in detail in the closing chapter will be drawn by the Mark of
the Beast foretold in Revelation  - and - *end*
     The Luciferian plot to overthrow the worship of Jesus has always worked in secret using
camouflages to remain hidden *end* It has not come upon the world suddenly but little by little *end* Likewise we must also trace this history of the great Luciferian Conspiracy little by little *end* We
will expose how primitive man was deceived into worshipping Lucifer then bring the reader
down  through  the  centuries  and  show  how  Lucifer  is  being  worshipped  in  these  modern
's *end*
       To  begin  this  study  let's  take  a  closer  look  at  the  name  "Lucifer"  itself *end*  The  name
"Lucifer" in Latin means "Light-Bearer" and may also mean the planet Venus which is the
"morning  star  at  dawn" *end*   In  Greek  mythology  Lucifer  was  personified  as  a  male  figure
bearing a torch *end* Hence we have the origin of the Light-Bearer of the Olympic Games *end* The
Greek  transliteration  of  the  name  of  this  incarnation  of  Lucifer  in  the  myth  was  Teitan *end*  In
middle English his name was Titan which also meant "Sungod" *end* .A distorted record of the
rebellion  of  Lucifer  and
in  Greek

the  rebel  giant  Nimrod  has  been  preserved

the  worship  of  Jehovah

in

   Sun  worship  was

the  greatest  rival  religion  of

through  Sun  worship

that

that  of

mythology *end* Titan Teitan the personification of Lucifer was the ancestor of a race of giant
humans here on earth who were overthrown by the Olympian gods *end*  Hence the word titan
today means "one gigantic in size or power." And the word titanism today in our language
means  "spirit  of  rebellion;  or  a  defiance  of  and  revolt  against
the  established  order  or
authority" *end*
       As  Lucifer  was  the  chief  leader  that  led  the  angelic  host  to  rebel  against  God  so  did
Nimrod  cause  the  early  descendants  of  Noah  to  rebel  against  God *end*  Flavius  Josephus  the
ancient Jewish historian wrote about Nimrod and how he seduced the people of his day to
rebel against God and was first to teach the arts of masonry while building the "Tower of
Babel." From the book "The Complete Works of Flavius Josephus" we read the following
     " .. *end* Now it was Nimrod who excited them to such an affront and contempt of God *end* He was
the  grandson  of  Ham  the  son  of  Noah  a  bold  man  and  of  great  strength  of  hand *end*  He
persuaded them not to ascribe it to God as if it was through his means they were happy but to
believe  that  it  was  their  own  courage  which  produced  that  happiness *end*  He  also  gradually
changed the government into tyranny seeing no other way of turning men from fear of God
but to bring them into a constant dependence on his own power *end* He also said he would be
revenged on God if he would have a mind to drown the world again for that he would build a
tower too high for the waters to be able to reach *end* And that he would avenge himself on God
for destroying their forefathers *end*
     "Now the multitude were very ready to follow the determination of Nimrod and to esteem
it a piece of cowardice to submit to God; and they built a tower neither sparing any pains nor
being  in  any  degree  negligent  about  the  work *end*  And  by  reason  of  the  multitude  of  hands
employed in it it grew very high sooner than any one could expect; but the thickness of it
was so great and it was so strongly built that thereby its great height seemed upon the view
to  be  less  than  it  really  was."  The  Complete  Works  of  Flavius  Josephus  Whiston  Kregel
Publications   p. *end*
     Nimrod tried to unite the whole known world of his day into a One World Government that
would be anti-God or Antichrist *end* But God wanted the sons of Noah to eventually replenish the
earth by traveling abroad the earth and settling in colonies *end* This would have kept in check the
wickedness that has always derived out of the cities *end* In the beginning it was not intended that
man be crowded together in large cities *end* This tower of Babel the building of which Nimrod
supervised  was
the
metropolis of the world and unite its inhabitants under the dictatorial rule of Nimrod *end* And its
tower was to be a monument to man to stand as a symbol of the wisdom of its builders *end* By
building the city of Babel Nimrod hoped to prevent the people from scattering abroad into
colonies as the Lord intended *end* While in the midst of this building when the tower reached an
height that it could today be called "skyscraper" our Lord came against it *end* In Genesis -
we read "And they said one to another Go to let us make brick and burn them thoroughly *end* And they had brick for stone and slime had they for mortar *end* And they said Go to let us build
us a city and a tower whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name lest we be
scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth *end* And  the Lord  came down to see the city
and the tower which the children of men builded *end* And the Lord said Behold the people is
one  and  they  have  one  language;  and  this  they  began  to  do  and  now  nothing  will  be
restrained  from  them  which  they  have  imagined  to  do *end*  Go  to  let  us  go  down  and  there
confound  their  language  that  they  may  not  understand  one  another's  speech *end*  So  the  Lord
scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth and they left off to build the
city *end* Therefore is the name of it Babel confusion; because the Lord did there confound the
language of all the earth and from thence did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of
all the earth."
     Nimrod who also built Nineveh was worshipped by its early inhabitants under his deified
name "Ninus." He was first to incite people to war with their neighbors after the confusion of

two  great  significances *end*  The  city  of  Babel  would  become

to  have

tongues had scattered the early descendants of Noah over the earth *end* Trogus Pompeius who
wrote  of  Ninus  states  that  the  first  King  of  Nineveh  caused  the  people  to  war  against
themselves *end*  Alexander  Hislop  compiled  this  statement  written  by  Trogus  Pompeius  the
ancient historian in his book The Two Babylons p *end*
       "  'Ninus  king  of  Assyrians'  says  Trogus  Pompeius  epitomized  by  Justin  'first  of  all
changed the contented moderation of the ancient manners incited by a new passion the desire
of conquest *end* He was the first who carried on war against his neighbours and he conquered all
nations from Assyria to Lybia as they were yet unacquainted with the arts of war.'"
     Hislop goes on to quote another ancient historian named Diodorus Siculus and shows how
Trogus Pompeius and Siculus both agree with each other *end*
       "  'Ninus  the  most  ancient  of  the  Assyrian  kings  mentioned  in  history  performed  great
actions *end*  Being  naturally  of  a  warlike  disposition  and  ambitious  of  glory  that  results  from
valeur  he  armed  a  considerable  number  of  young  men  that  were  brave  and  vigorous  like
himself trained them up a long time in laborious exercises and hardships and by that means
accustomed them to bear the fatigues of war and to face dangers with intrepidity.' " Loizeaux
Brothers Neptune NJ  *end*
     Hence Nimrod Ninus was celebrated at Nineveh which he built as a War-god and his
epics as a hunter a warrior and his death were later imitated in the Assyrian Babylonian
Egyptian Greek Roman and American Indian Mysteries *end* His Egyptian name was Osiris *end* To the Romans he was also worshipped as Mars which means "The Rebel" from which our
name March was derived *end* He was Zernebogus to the Anglo-Saxon which means "The Seed
of the Prophet Cush" *end* But Nimrod's ancient Babel name was Merodach which means "To
Be Bold or Rebel" *end*  So here we find the real meaning of these two gods found in Scripture
"Bel The Confounder is confounded Merodach The Rebel is broken in pieces Jeremiah
." We will study more of the origin of the name "Bel" later *end*
       In  the  Babylonian  myth  of  Tammuz  or  Thammuz  the  equivalent  to  the  Egyptian  god
Osiris who actually was Nimrod the ringleader in the great apostasy against our Lord was
ordered to be killed by a certain king *end* The reason given for his death was that Tammuz the
incarnation  of  the  Sun-god  tried  to  promote  the  worship  of  Astrology  to  this  certain  king *end*
However this king ordered him to be put to death *end* Maimonides another ancient historian had
read deeply into the learning of the Chaldeans *end* He describes this myth quoted by Hislop in
The Two Babylons p *end*
       "When  the  false  prophet  named  Thammuz  preached  to  a  certain  king  that  he  should
worship the seven stars and the twelve signs of the Zodiac that king ordered him to be put to
a terrible death *end* On the night of his death all the images assembled from the ends of the earth
into  the  temple  of  Babylon  to  the  great  golden  image  of  the  Sun  which  was  suspended
between heaven and earth *end* That image prostrated itself in the midst of the temple and so did
all  the  images  around  it  while  it  related  to  them  all  that  had  happened  to  Thammuz *end*  The
images wept and lamented all the night long and then in the morning they flew away each to
his own temple again to the ends of the earth *end* And hence arose the custom every year on the
first day of the month of Thammuz to mourn and to weep for Thammuz."
     Now in the worship of the Sun-god among the Mexicans they believed that for the Sun-
god to bestow life on the world he needed also to receive life from it  *end* To show the reader
the murderous character of Satan displayed in people and what human beings can be led to do
by his false religious spirit we will explore some of the reasons behind the rites of human
sacrifices *end*
     To the ancient Mexicans the heart was the seat and symbol of life and bleeding hearts of
men and animals were presented to the Sun-god to maintain him in vigor and enable him to
run his course across the sky  *end*
     Now when the Israelites turned their backs from worshipping the Lord they adopted the
worship of the pagan gods from their neighbors *end* And they too were led by pagan high priests

identifies  him  as

the  god  of

the  sky  and

to sacrifice human beings *end* "They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor and ate the sacrifices
of the dead *end* Thus they provoked the Lord to anger with their inventions and the plague brake
in upon them *end* And they served their idols which were a snare unto them *end* Yea they sacrificed
their sons and their daughters unto DEVILS and shed innocent blood even the blood of their
sons and their daughters whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan and the land was
polluted with blood." Psalms   - *end*
     The ignorant Israelites were not sacrificing their children to gods as they thought but unto
devils *end*  Paul  over    years  later  said  the  sacrifices  of  the  Gentiles  which  the  Israelites
adopted were actually "Sacrifices to Devils." "But I say that the things which the Gentiles
sacrifice  they  sacrifice  to  devils  and  not  to  God  and  I  would  not  that  ye  should  have
fellowship with devils." .Corinthians  *end*
     As history has documented that greatest object in pagan worship was the sun who was
symbolized all over the world as a heavenly bull  *end* The pagans displayed the cosmic god in
their arts as a bull standing on its hind legs with a tail hoofs and horns with a man's head and
arms with a threeprong pitchfork in his hand *end* So the ancient cosmic symbol of the Sun-god
with hoofs a tail horns and a pitchfork is where we today get our symbol for Satan as having
hoofs a tail and horns with a pitchfork in his hand *end*
     In pagan philosophy lightning was the manifestation of their god's wrath and an agent of
his punishment *end* The thunder was the voice of his warnings  *end*  In ancient Greece thunder
and lightning were believed by the worshippers of Zeus to be manifestations of his presence *end* Any spot struck by lightning became sacred *end* The very name "Zeus" skt *end* dyaus "The Bright
Sky"
its  phenomena   *end*  In  Rome  he  was
worshipped as Jupiter in Scandinavia Thor and in Canaan Baal the Storm god *end*
     Lightning from the sky separates into branches; hence the lightning bolt found in the hand
of the supreme god of the sky was stylized into a pitchfork *end* This was a symbol for his power
as he who controls the lightning bolt *end*
     Besides Satan's personation of Christ just before Jesus' Second Coming what other power
of  God
wonders *end* "And he doeth great wonders so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the
earth in the sight of men." And this is still future *end*
     The prince of the power of the air is also the prince of darkness *end* Just as the pagan was
deceived by Satan in ancient times so is the Christian in modern times *end* And if man can learn
how  to  bring  electricity  down  from  the  sky  and  harness  its  energy  how  much  more  could
Satan a supernatural being who is even called in the Bible "The Prince of the Power of the
Air" Ephesians  able to cause destructive storms *end* And not only this but also give his
followers secret knowledge how to do the same to their enemies *end*
       Because  the  Sun-god  was  believed  to  have  this  power  and  would  also  give  it  to  his
followers
the  pagans
worshipped their gods through fear *end* In Bible Truth it is the goodness of God that turns an evil
person to worship Him Romans  *end* But in pagan belief it was the anger of the Storm god
his  hatred  for  man  his  unmerciful  attributes  that  made  the  pagans  bow  before  him *end*  Not
through love but through fear *end* Their whole worship revolved around winning the evil one's
favor by pacifying him through sacrifice and appeasement *end*
     The main features behind the pure demon worship of ancient Babylon can be seen today by
the  open  worship  of  the  Yezidis  of  Kurdistan  Armenia  and  the  Caucasus *end*  In  their  pagan
worship they believe it is "Melek Taus" who is the Devil that was the co-creator of the world
 *end* Their religion today is the worship of both Good and Evil or Christ and Satan *end* They
have  adopted  some  heretical  elements  of  Christianity  and  some  precepts  of  Islam *end*  They
regard  Jesus  as  an  angel
in  human  form  and  recognize  Muhammad  as  a  Prophet  with
Abraham *end* They practice circumcision and baptism *end* Instead of Christ as the creative agent of
the  Godhead  Ephesians    they  regard  the  Devil  as  the  creative  agent  of  the  Supreme

the  Devil

God and seek even today to appease him as the author of evil *end* They also avoid mentioning
the  name  of
in  fear  of  offending  him   *end*  We  will  study  another  religious
movement that has the dualism of good and evil to be worshipped from today's Rock Era a
little  later *end*  This  study  should  be  particularly  interesting  for  people  who  called  themselves
Christians during the epidemic of the Beatle hysteria *end*
       The  Yezedis  like  most  pagans  believe  their  destinies  are  not  determined  by  a  good
loving  kind  and  gentle  God  but  by  the  Evil  One  who  has  no  mercy  who  delights  in
destroying mankind *end*  They believe that the good God will forgive no matter how they regard
him *end* But it is the Evil One whose favor they must secure *end* He as the destructive deity must
be pacified by offering him sacrifice penance and worship *end*
     Is this not similar to how multitudes who call themselves Christians are led to worship the
Lord of the Scriptures *end* Is it not pictured by erring priests and pastors that God is a vengeful
God who is ever waiting to cast the unrepentant into a burning place of torment or sent the
repentant to purgatory so they may be tortured by fire until they suffer enough to be purified
for Heaven *end* Is it not screamed dramatized and shouted to congregations about how gruesome
are the tortures of them who are now so they say in Hell the burning place of torment *end*
     There is hardly a Christian denomination that doesn't teach the doctrine of Life After Death
or Immortality of the Soul *end* But the Bible clearly states that no one lives on after death *end* "For
the living know that they shall die But THE DEAD KNOW NOT ANYTHING neither have
they any more a reward for the memory of them is forgotten *end* Also their love and their hatred
and their envy is now perished neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing
that is done under the sun." Ecclesiastes  *end*
     If the wicked are tormented in Hell Fire as taught by most Christian priests and pastors
when the wicked die would they not have some knowledge of the torment they are supposed
to be experiencing *end* "Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do do it with thy might For there is no
work nor device nor knowledge nor wisdom in the grove whither thou goest." Ecclesiastes
 *end*
     If the righteous go to Heaven after death as taught in most Christian churches would they
not be praising the Lord *end* The Bible says "The Dead Praise Not The Lord Neither Any That
Go Down In Silence." Psalms  *end*
     If man goes to Heaven at death like most Christian churches tell their members wouldn't
these  righteous  people  have  some  thoughts  or  ideas  where  they  are *end*  The  Bible  says  "His
breath goeth forth he returneth to his earth; in that VERY DAY HIS THOUGHTS PERISH."
Psalm  *end*
     Some go to the gravesites to talk to their dead friends or relatives but the Bible says "His
sons come to honour and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low but he perceiveth it not
of  them."  Job   *end*  "For  in  death  there  is  NO  REMEMBRANCE  OF  THEE  IN  THE
GRAVE WHO SHALL GIVE THEE THANKS?" Psalms  *end*
       Jesus  plainly  stated  that  the  dead  are  still  in  the  graves  at  His  Second  Coming  not  in
Heaven "Verily Verily I say unto you The hour is coming and now is WHEN THE DEAD
SHALL HEAR THE VOICE OF THE SON OF GOD AND THEY THAT HEAR SHALL
LIVE."  .. *end*  "MARVEL  NOT  AT  THIS  FOR  THE  HOUR  IS  COMING  IN  WHICH  ALL
THAT ARE IN THE GRAVES SHALL HEAR HIS VOICE AND SHALL COME FORTH;
they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the
resurrection of damnation." John  *end*
     Both the wicked and the righteous are still in their graves *end* However there is a Hell Fire
where the wicked will surely be destroyed *end* But this is still future *end* This hell fire comes from
Heaven not from some secret place where the dead are now receiving their punishment *end* The
Devil is not in charge of some secret place called Hell that is under the earth where all the
wicked  have  been  thrown *end*  Nor  does  the  Devil  run  around  with  his  pitchfork  sticking  and
burning the wicked both day and night *end* The fire will be from Heaven and will destroy the

wicked and also the Devil himself *end* Revelation  *end*
     Peter foretold Christ's Second Coming would be in fire "The Lord is not slack concerning
his promise as some men count slackness but is longsuffering to us-word not willing that
any should perish but that all should come to repentance *end* But the day of the Lord will come
as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the
elements shall MELT WITH FERVENT HEAT THE EARTH ALSO AND THE WORKS
THAT ARE THEREIN SHALL BE BURNED UP." .Peter   *end*
     David foretold Christ's Second Coming  years before Jesus was born *end* In Psalm -
 we read "Our God shall come and shall not keep silence a fire shall devour before Him
and it shall be tempestuous round about Him *end* He shall call to the heavens from above and to
the earth that He may Judge His people *end* Gather my saints together unto me; those that have
made a covenant with me by sacrifice."
     Paul also foretold that Jesus would be a consuming fire to those who have rejected the
Gospel *end*   .Thessalonians  -  "And  to  you  who  are  troubled  rest  with  us  when  the  Lord
Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire taking vengeance
on them that know not God and that obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ Who shall
be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of
His  power."  In  Isaiah    we  read   "Thou  shalt  be  visited  of  the  Lord  of  hosts  with
THUNDER  AND  WITH  EARTHQUAKE  AND  GREAT  NOISE  WITH  STORM  AND
TEMPEST AND THE FLAME OF DEVOURING FIRE."
     The doctrine of the wicked being thrown into ever burning fire cannot be found in either
the Old or New Testaments but it is found on the pages of Sun worship *end* The Hell Fire Jesus
plainly  described  in  Scripture  has  two  time  periods *end*  There  are  two  different  times  fire  and
brimstone  shall  rain  from  Heaven *end*  The  first  shall  be  at  Christ's  Second  Coming *end*  But  the
consuming  fire  that  finally  destroys  the  Devil  his  angels  and  the  wicked  will  not  be  until
after the  years described in Revelation -   *end* This is when the wicked will be
raised from the dead and Satan will make a last effort to destroy the New Jerusalem "And
they went up on the breadth of the earth and compassed the camp of the saints about and the
beloved city; and fire CAME DOWN FROM GOD OUT OF HEAVEN AND DEVOURED
THEM *end* AND THE DEVIL THAT DECEIVED THEM WAS CAST INTO THE LAKE OF
FIRE AND BRIMSTONE WHERE THE BEAST AND THE FALSE PROPHET ARE AND
SHALL BE TORMENTED DAY AND NIGHT FOR EVER AND EVER." Revelation
 *end*
     This whole earth is going to be covered with fire *end* Fire is a purifying agent *end* And it will be
fire that our Lord will use to purify the earth of its pollutions caused by Satan and man for
 years *end*
     In the book of Malachi we read the following "For behold the day cometh that shall burn
as an oven and all the proud yea and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that
cometh shall burn them up saith the Lord of hosts that it shall leave them neither root nor
branch." Malachi  *end*
     The Lord destroyed everything in Noah's day by water; that was just a shadow of the earth
when it shall be covered by fire *end* Peter saw this was to come and said in .Peter  "For this
they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of God the heavens were of old and the earth
standing  out  of
then  was  being
overflowed with water perished But the heavens and the earth which are now by the same
word  are  kept  in  store  reserved  unto  FIRE  against  the  day  of  judgment  and  perdition  of
ungodly men."
       As  stated  before  there  are  two  periods  of  this  Hell  Fire  predicted  by  both  the  Old
Testament  Prophets  and  by  the  New  Testament  Apostles *end*  And  there  are  also  to  be  two
resurrections *end* In Revelation - it plainly states the resurrection of the wicked and their
destruction will not happen until the -year millenium is over *end* "And I saw an angel come

that

down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand *end* And he
laid  hold  on  the  dragon  that  old  serpent  which  is  the  Devil  and  Satan  and  bound  him  a
thousand years And cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up and set a seal upon
him that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years should be fulfilled
and after that he must be loosed a little season *end* And I saw thrones and they sat upon them
and judgment was given unto them and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the
witness of Jesus and for the word of God and which had not worshipped the beast neither
his  image  neither  had  received  his  mark  upon  their  foreheads  or  in  their  hands;  and  they
lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years." We will study more of this very important
doctrine later *end*
     Now among the first inhabitants of the earth Lucifer's first lie was "YE SHALL NOT
SURELY DIE Genesis ." And this same LIE of the Devil has been used from Adam and
Eve's day to our present time today *end* Here lies the origin of the foundation of the falsehood of
immortal soul reincarnation all forms of Spiritualism Astrology Black Magic Necromancy
Purgatory  and  Hell  the  burning  place  of  torment *end*  The  whole  system  of  the  Mystery  of
Iniquity  is  based  on  this  lie  of  the  Devil  "Life  after  Death."  But  the  Bible  is  very  clear
"THOU SHALT SURELY DIE." Genesis   *end*
     Man does not continue to live after death as most have been deceived into believing *end* "For
the living know that they shall die but the dead know not anything." Ecclesiastes  *end*
       As  stated  before  the  myths  about  "Life  After  Death"  can  be  traced  in  the  legends  of
Nimrod  who  became  the  great  god  of  the  Assyrians  and  Babylonians   *end*   At  Nineveh
Austen H *end* Layard from the British Museum uncovered the ancient city and discovered over
  tablets  describing  the  ancient  history  of  the  Assyrian  Empire   *end*  Layard  found
inscriptions at Nineveh that said it was Ninus who built the city  *end* The word "Nineveh"
itself means "The Habitation of Ninus" *end* But it has been discovered that the name Ninus
was just a deified name the early Assyrians called Nimrod because the Bible itself says it was
Nimrod  who  built  Nineveh  Genesis   *end*  Nimrod  Ninus  was  said  to  have  been  killed
according to the inscriptions but his "spirit" became immortal and flew up to the Sun and he
became "Beelsamon" "Lord of Heaven" *end*
     In all forms of witchcraft as in all modern forms today the doctrine of "Immortality of the
Soul" was the center of their whole pagan belief and worship *end* Pagans believed that when they
died they took possession of one of the stars in Heaven *end* The ignorant pagans like multitudes
of Christians today believe that the spirits of the dead are "ministering spirits sent forth to
minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation." Hebrews  *end*
     If the reader has ever read into the history of any nation the history of the people shows
that their whole culture was surrounded by the belief in "Life After Death" "Reincarnation"
and  communicating  with  the  dead *end*  Multitudes  of  pagan  traditions  worldwide  have  their
origin in the Legends of Nimrod *end*

   The  Babylonians  taught  that  the  fate  of  everything  was  dependent  on  the  sky *end*  The
Babylonians as most ancient people believed that each mortal like the gods had his own star
in  the  Sky   *end*  Here  we  can  begin  to  see  why  primitive  men  believed  their  chief  gods
inhabited the planets and named the planets as the homes of their gods *end* Saturn the Roman
god of crops is believed to be the star-god Stephen said the ancient Israelites worshipped in
their apostasy under the name of Remphan  *end* "Yea ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch
and the Star of your god Remphan figures which ye made to worship them and I will carry
you away beyond Babylon." Acts  see also Amos  *end*
     This will also help us to understand the cosmic religion of Astrology and how Astrology
ties in with Sun worship *end* Astrology was actually the origin of the pagan sciences and pagan
symbols *end* John in the book of Revelation was given this sacred number  of Astrology to
identify  who  this  beast  is  see  Revelation  -  and    that  Jesus  warns  not  to  be
identified with Revelation  *end*

   The  Egyptians  Persians  Greeks  Romans  Hindus  and  American  Indians

     In the ancient Babylonian astrological system it is the Sun-god who is the ruler and main
god of the zodiac *end* And all the gods of heaven the stars were considered offspring of the sun *end* According to pagan philosophy all the star gods you have heard about in school were actually
manifestations of the heat fire and light which flowed from the sun *end* It was believed that it
was the Sun-god who was the source of all things and all the other gods were but emanations
of the sun "flesh of his flesh." Therefore all the manifestations of the gods of nature were just
manifestations  of  the  one  god  the  Sun  whose  worship  by  primitive  man  was  in  reality  to
Satan *end* Even Lucifer's name means "Day Star" the "Illuminated One" or "Shining One" *end*

the
Babylonians all believed that their gods were just representations of the one god *end* The ancient
people  shortly  after  the  flood  had  a  knowledge  of  the  True  God  of  Noah  Shem  and
Abraham *end*  But  the  worship  of  the  True  God  of  Noah  Shem  and  Abraham  soon  became
perverted into idolatry by the larger population when Nimrod tried to unite the whole world
into  a  One  World  Government *end*  And  this  anti-God  movement  shall  be  attempted  by  some
modern Nimrods in our time *end*
     Both history and the Bible reveal that the greatest mystery to mankind has always been the
Universe *end*  And  Satan  the  Prince  of  the  Power  of  the  Air  used  man's  curiosity  about  the
heavenly host to cause man to worship them instead of their Creator *end* "And the children of
Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord and served Baalim the Sun-god." Judges  *end*
     The word Baalim is a term to describe the whole system of Sun worship *end* Augustine said in
his book The City of God that all the learned pagan doctors declared that all the chief gods of
the Greek-Roman world were 'one and the same love' and that all the stars were part of love
and  had  rational  souls   *end*  All  the  chief  gods  of  Greece  and  Rome  were  the  same  gods
worshipped in Babylonia Assyria Egypt Persia and North and South America  *end* Only the
names were different like their languages and cultures were *end* It was from Babylon Babel that
Sun worship started *end* And it is also where all ancient and modern nations today receive their
system of Astrology  *end*
     In pagan philosophy the stars controlled the affairs of the human race *end* Hence the science
of Astrology claims to interpret the will of the star gods *end* The chief star gods of the pagans
were the gods of Astrology which were believed to be just emanations of the one god the
Sun-God  the ruler of the Zodiac *end* Astrology is the foundation of all the pagan sciences of
the occult whose author is Lucifer and his spirit guides are his angels *end* Spiritualism which is
just another name for Witchcraft is today among the young the biggest rival of Jesus Christ *end* It  will  be  through  Spiritualism  that  men  and  women  will  come  with  all  manner  of  lying
wonders that will gather the whole world under Satan's banner *end* "Then if any man shall say
unto you Lo here is Christ or there believe it not *end* For there shall arise false Christs and false
prophets  and  shall  show  great  signs  and  wonders;  insomuch  that  if  it  were  possible  they
shall deceive the very elect." Matthew  *end*
     Spiritualism  Witchcraft  will  deceive the whole world into accepting a strong delusion
that will bring Satan to finally use his crowning deception that will cause most to lose their
salvation *end* Lucifer this Old Serpent called the Devil will personate Jesus Christ just before
the real Christ comes the Second Time *end* This will be Satan's last effort to destroy mankind *end* However  students  of  the  Bible  who  have  made  Scripture  their  only  standard  to  judge
between truth and error will not be fooled into worshipping Satan as Christ *end* For the satanic
movement to unite the world under one banner and Christ walking upon this earth again is a
complete contradiction of Scripture *end* But to actually understand any of this the reader must
not be ignorant of Satan's devices; so we need to examine what the Bible says Spiritualism or
what Witchcraft is *end* This we will study in Part II of this Chapter *end*

others into rejecting the True Christ *end* "For they are the spirits of DEVILS working miracles
which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world to gather them to the battle
of that great day of God Almighty." Revelation  *end*
       There  is  absolutely  nothing  romantic  about  Satan *end*  He  will  give  some  power  to  work
miracles but this is his way of deceiving *end* Just as God uses man to lead others to Him so does
Satan *end* However unlike God once Satan has used a person for his own purposes Satan will
cast away all whom he has used to deceive others like a man casts away his trash into the
trash can *end* So to help a Bible student avoid falling into any of Satan's traps one can learn from
the Scriptures and from those whom Satan has already used how not to become another one
of his victims *end*
     To start we need to study again the first deception at the Garden of Eden *end* As we stated
before the Devil uses camouflages to keep his worship hidden *end* The Sun and Nimrod were
only  a  front  used  by  Lucifer
the  first
camouflage he used to deceive Adam and Eve was the serpent *end* The very thing Satan used to
deceive Adam and Eve became eventually one of the most sacred symbols of Sun worship *end* Instead of the serpent as being a symbol of Satan and deception as the Bible instructs the
serpent became a symbol of the "Great Benefactor and Healer" of mankind *end* The serpent was
worshipped as the "God of Healing" and "Life-Restorer." "YE SHALL NOT SURELY DIE"
Genesis  was Lucifer's first lie to our first parents *end* The serpent the god of healing was
generally represented in the pagan arts entwined on a stick staff or a stock of a tree  *end* Here
we find the origin of the strange symbol that the American Medical Association AMA uses
today *end* This medical insignia was originally the symbol of the Egyptian god Hermes who we
will see in a moment was Nimrod's father Cush *end* And it's here we find the origin of the word
hermetic *end*  This  ancient  word  found  in  classical  literature  actually  derived  from  the  ancient
Egyptian  god  of  medicine *end*  This  name  is  actually  Chaldean  and  the  Greeks  and  Egyptians
adopted this god from the Babylonians *end* The very word hermetic means the hidden knowledge
of magic occult sciences etc  *end* Not only was the serpent worshipped by the ignorant pagans
as "The Great Benefactor" for mankind the serpent ironically enough was worshipped also as

to  bow  before  him *end*  However

to  get  multitudes

in

language *end*  This

is

the  Mayan

the  exact  same  meaning  for  Quetzalcoatl

"The Great Enlightener." What did Satan say to Adam and Eve besides "Ye shall not surely
die?"  In  Genesis    we  read  "FOR  GOD  DOTH  KNOW  THAT  IN  THE  DAY  YE  EAT
THEREOF THEN YOUR EYES SHALL BE OPENED AND YE SHALL BE AS GODS
KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL."
     In The Two Babylons by Hislop p *end*  we read the following
"Along  with  the  sun  as  the  great  fire-god  and  in  due  time  identified  with  him  was  the
serpent  worshipped *end*  In  the  mythology  of  the  primitive  world  says  Owen  'the  serpent  is
universally the symbol of the sun *end* In Egypt one of the commonest symbols of the sun or sun
god is a disc with a serpent around it *end* The original reason of that identification seems just to
have been that as the sun was the great enlightener of the physical world so the serpent was
held to have been the great enlightener of the spiritual by giving mankind the 'Knowledge of
Good and Evil.' ' " The ancient Mayans of the Yucatan in Mexico worshipped the serpent god
under the name of Can *end* Can means "serpent" in the Mayan language as Can or A-Can was the
ancient Sumerian and ancient Scottish word for serpent *end* Here we find the origin of our word
canny shrewd or serpent-like *end* The Babylonians worshipped Can the serpent and Vul the god
of fire *end* The Romans simply combined the two words into 'Vulcan" the Roman god of fire
from  when  also  comes  our  word  "volcano"   *end*  This  seems  to  be  how  the  Mayans  and
Mexicans  named  their  gods *end*  They  too  combined  two  words  to  describe  their  serpent  god *end* "Kulkul" means "beautiful bird" and "Can" serpent *end* Hence "Kulkulcan" which means "Bird
Serpent"
the
Mexican pagan messiah in central Mexico  *end*
     Interestingly enough the cosmic symbol for Quetzalcoatl was a feathered serpent *end* Here is
another  interesting  observation *end*  The  origin  of  the  word  "Vatican"  also  derived  from  two
words *end* The Latin word "vatic" or "vatis" means "prophet or soothsayer"  *end* The combined
word "Vatican" appears to mean "divination by the serpent" *end* The symbol for Astrology is
often shown in pagan arts as a serpent in a circular position with his tail in his mouth *end* This
represented eternal life *end*
     There is the strong evidence from Scripture that the serpent originally had wings and flew
instead of having legs as the evolutionists say *end*  The  Scriptures  reveal it was a curse for the
serpent  to  travel  on  his  belly  as  he  does  now *end*  "And  the  Lord  God  said  unto  the  serpent
because  thou  hast  done  this  thou  art  cursed  above  all  cattle  and  above  every  beast  of  the
field upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life." Genesis
 *end*
     Hence that feathered serpent that has been displayed in pagan arts and worshipped as the
god  of  healing  is  none  other  but  "that  Old  Serpent  called  the  Devil  and  Satan  which
deceiveth the whole world." Revelation  *end*
     While Satan changed the image of the serpent into something to be adored and worshipped
the  goat  from  antiquity  symbolized  the  Devil *end*  The  goat  known  for  its  agility  stubborn
character and having its own way is what Astrologers say people are who are born under the
sign of Capricorn the He-Goat *end* Witches in the Middle Ages were widely reputed to worship
the Devil in the form of a goat  *end* During the Middle Ages there was a widespread witch
panic that produced witch hunts and witch trials *end* Witches were often charged with poisonings
and  other  injuries  as  well  as  murder *end*  The  charge  of  murder  might  have  been  derived  from
making a wax image of a hated person and consuming it over a slow fire or sticking it with
pins *end* African witchdoctors Haitian experts in Voo-Doo and American Indian medicine men
indulged in this Satanic Black Art *end* The Middle Ages witch trials record how multitudes of
witches  confessed  under  torture  that  they  held  local  meetings  called  covens  to  adore  their
master  make  plans  to  execute  the  diabolic  will  and  partake  in  bestial  rites *end*  In  southern
Europe the site where the witches met was called a synagogue; in Germany it was called a
blocksberg  *end* These meetings usually took place at midnight *end* It was brought out during the
trials that witches claimed they came to their meetings by being carried by the Devil others

were able to fly by anointing themselves with oils from the bodies of murdered infants; still
others  rode  broomsticks  or  a  cow  or  a  goat *end*  At  the  rendezvous  Satan  appeared  as  a  black
animal  often  a  goat  or  as  a  man  with  cloven  feet   *end*  There  are  many  different  sects  in
modern witchcraft today; however modern day witches do not believe that the Devil exists *end* They are not Satanist old women with long black hair and a wart on their nose *end* A Christian
will be shocked to know that ancient Witchcraft has been revived and modernized among the
young people today *end* And it is the religion of some of those who control the wealth of the
world *end*  Their  covens  churches  are  today  Federally  recognized  tax  exempt  churches  and
enjoy the same rights under the protection of the law as do the Christians *end* And believe it or
not  there  are  millions  of  both  male  and  female  witches  here  in  the  United  States  alone *end* Witchcraft is the biggest rival religion of Christianity in England and America  *end*
    It  is  interesting  enough  however  that  these  modern  witches  exalt  the  horn  gods  and  the
pagan goddesses such as the Egyptian pagan trinity Osiris Isis Horus which originated in the
worship  of  Nimrod  the  Sun  his  wife  Semiramis  the  moon  and  Tammuz  the  Morning
Star *end*
     Like their pagan brethren modern day witches are ignorant to the fact that these gods do
not exist *end* Even though they claim the Devil does not exist they too are in reality bowing their
knee before him *end* They exalt the gods Satan hid behind to deceive the ancient nations *end* Pan or
Bacchus is another god the witches exalt and worship *end* It depends on what coven they belong
to *end* Anyway how was this ancient pagan god displayed in pagan art *end* He had a man's head with
horns and cloven feet *end*
     Now witchcraft as stated before has been modernized *end* Modern day witches who worship
the gods of cosmic forces claim now to work magic and cast spells for the general good of the
community *end* This kind of witchcraft is called white magic *end* Those who practice casting spells
that injure people practice what is known as Black Magic *end*
     However most of these modern day witches claim to be good witches as in The Wizard of
Oz and unlike medieval witchcraft that made an image out of wax to stick pins in it so the
person the wax image looked like would die these modern day witches claim now that this
wax image is used to heal people *end* This revised and modern form of witchcraft is called today
Wicca which is the feminine form of an Old English word "Wicce" meaning -- "Witch"  *end*
The main feature of Wicca is however nature worship *end* Just as the ancient Baal worshippers
in Babylonia believed it was the cosmic Star gods that were responsible for pouring out the
rain  from  Heaven  and  caused  fertility  among  the  plants  and  mankind  so  do  these  ignorant
people in these modern witch covens teach their little ones these things *end*
     The word Baal so often seen throughout the Old Testament was used to describe a god *end* The word means "Lord" or "Master"  and in the Bible it was the name for the Sun-god *end*
     Now kings of pagan nations often were considered the incarnation of the Sun-god and to
identify with the Sun-god the kings would adopt the name of his god as Jezebel's father did in
.Kings  *end* His name was "Ethbaal" which means "with Baal" or "Baal's man"  *end*
     Just as ancient Sun-kings pretended to be the ancient incarnation of the Sun-god so does
modern witchcraft teach that the High Priest is the personification of the horned god Pan or
Osiris *end*  And
the
personification of Isis Diana or one of the other names this pagan goddess has throughout the
world *end* Baal worship was basically a fertility cult that taught its followers that the Sun-god and
Moon-goddess  controlled  the  seasons  brought  fertility  etc *end*  Here  we  find  the  origin  of  the
beliefs of Wicca *end*
     Witches ancient and modern take off their clothes during their meetings as a symbol of
freedom and so the power they say they receive from their gods can freely flow from their
bodies *end* A circle is drawn to contain and concentrate the power the witches claim to receive
through lewd dancing and chanting *end* On nights of the full moon and other festivals the High
Priest of witchcraft performs a ritual known as "Drawing Down the Moon." This is taught to

the  High  Priestess  of

covens

these

like

ancient  Sun  worship

is

like  all  forms  of  Spiritualism

new members to explain how the High Priestess becomes the incarnation of the Moongoddess
 *end*
       Witches  believe  that  the  build-up  of  power  is  achieved  much  more  readily  when  the
participants are naked and when a certain sexual tension is present *end* When these witches reach
the power they want charged in their atmosphere they begin to cast their spells *end* They claim
the spells should always be for the good; an evil spell they say rebounds threefold upon the
head of its creator *end* After their spells are cast the witches settle down to a ceremony that is
similar to the holy communion held for the Egyptian god Osiris *end* However instead of a round
disk wafer that was an Egyptian symbol of the sun some modern day witches make cakes in
the shape of a five pointed star called the Pentagram *end* This to the occultist is one of the most
powerful weapons in magic *end* The Pentagram symbolism is based on that of the number five
which according to Astrology stands for the living world of nature such as Air Fire Water
Earth  and  the  Spirit  of  their  god  and  pagan  goddess  who  used  the  elements  according  to
witchcraft to create the Universe *end*
     The number five in Astrology also represents the four directions and the center for the five
senses smell taste sight touch and hearing *end*
is  a  microcosm  miniature

universe; man is the ruler of nature and as the miniature image the potential master of all
things  *end* So the Pentagram five pointed star with one of its points projecting upwards is
imagined in Witchcraft as a man's body with arms and legs extended and is a symbol of the
dominance of the divine spirit *end* It is used as a magical weapon for invoking good influences
and keeps the evil spirits at bay say those who practice white magic *end*
     Many of our youth reject the religion of the Bible and now worship the created things
instead of the Creator through this new modern form of Witchcraft because Witchcraft today
is attractive and has taken on a brighter look *end* Instead of the satanic evil looking people of the
Middle Ages the witches of today have been for the past century portrayed as good people
who fight against the evil forces of this world such as "Wonder Woman" with her sign of
white magic the Pentagram displayed on her forehead *end* But to distinguish the bad witches
from the good witches say the occultists a reversed Pentagram with two points upward is a
symbol of Black Magic and of those who do worship the Devil *end* The two points of the star
pointed upwards suggests the horns of the Devil symbolized as a goat attacking the Heavens
with his horns  *end* This five pointed star which has two points upward was and is today
worn  as  an  amulet  by  open  Devil  worshippers  and  by  many  modern  day  magicians  and
wizards *end* Originally this evil sign was worn to show Satan that they had chosen him as their
leader  *end*
     Is this not chilling and frightening to know that multitudes of women of high fashion may
not  be  aware  that  when  they  wear  that  little  gold  chain  around  their  neck  with  this  five
pointed star with two points upward they are showing they have chosen the Devil's side and
seek his protection *end* Is it not chilling to know that they who call themselves Freemasons and
the ladies who call themselves "The Order of the Eastern Star" display this evil sign in their
lodges *end* We will study even more shocking truths about the origin and purpose of these Secret
Societies in the next chapter *end*
     As stated earlier there are many sects of modern witchcraft today and many variations
found in their rituals *end* In some covens the cakes they use in their communion are made into the
shape of a crescent which is the symbol of the Moon-goddess *end* These cakes by the way are
made of salt honey wine meal oil and in some covens blood *end* They are eaten in honour of
the Egyptian god Horus  or whatever god the coven exalts *end*
     In ancient witchcraft the cakes were round with a cross drawn on them that represented the
first letter of the name of the ancient dead and risen pagan messiah "Tammuz" who was the
incarnation of the Sun-god and the son of the Moon-goddess the Queen of Heaven *end* Even the
Israelites  when  they  turned  from  the  worship  of  our  Creator  made  these  same  cakes  that

honoured the pagan queen of Heaven and her god-child Tammuz *end* In Jeremiah  our Lord
condemned this ancient ritual in the worship of these cosmic gods *end* "The children gather wood
and the fathers kindle the fire and the women knead their dough to make cakes to the queen
of  heaven  and  to  pour  out  drink  offerings  unto  other  gods  that  they  may  provoke  me  to
anger."
     Today the Roman Catholic Church dedicates these same cakes to the Virgin Mary whom
they ironically call the Queen of Heaven  *end* These cakes are called by Roman Catholic "Hot
Cross Buns"  *end* The name of this pagan goddess the Israelites worshipped and dedicated
these cakes to is found in Judges  *end* Her name to the Israelites was Ashtaroth *end* To the early
Romans her name was Venus the goddess of love *end*
     Witchcraft is just another word for Spiritualism but the modern word used to cover-up the
evil  name  of  Witchcraft  so  it  may  be  taught  in  Colleges  is  "Parapsychology."  Now  to
understand this other abomination found in both ancient and modern Witchcraft the reader
must understand that it was the Sun-god and Moon-goddess who created the whole Universe
according to these witches *end* To honour this pagan belief a ritual called "The Great Rite" is
strictly  observed  among  these  socalled  "good"  witches *end*  Since  the  High  Priest  in  a  coven  is
believed to be the incarnation of Pan the Sun-god and the High Priestess is the incarnation of
the  Queen  of  Heaven  the  Moon-goddess  these  two  mimic  the  myth  in  the  creation  of  the
Universe by the Sun-god and the Moon-goddess when they perform "The Great Rite" ritual
which is engaging in sacred prostitution *end*
     This is justified by the witches on the grounds of fertility because after all they say Wicca
is a fertility cult  *end*
     To try to understand any of this perversion so you can teach others how to avoid it the
reader simply needs to realize that this abominable practice of sacred prostitution found today
in modern witchcraft is nothing new *end* All ancient heathen worship of the Sun-gods had within
its philosophies Phallicism *end* What is Phallicism *end* It is the veneration and worship of male and
female sex organs *end* The union of male and female organs is symbolized in witchcraft as a point
within a circle and also as two triangles uniting to make a "Hexagram"   better known
today as the "Star of David." The truth is King David of Israel never carried this emblem that
is now the symbol of Israel *end* This emblem was adopted from witchcraft by some Jewish priests
who had explored deep into the Babylonian religion during their captivity in Babylon *end* From
here sprang witchcraft in another garb called the Cabala *end*
     The Mexican Indian centuries before seeing a white man had the Hexagram as the symbol
of their phallic worship of the cosmic gods *end* Often the Hexagram is displayed as a symbol of
the  planets that serpentine their way through the Zodiac *end* The Sun in the center is displayed
in a circle with a point in its center *end*
     Usually before these modern day witches partake of the cake and wine to honour Horus or
Pan as we examined in part one of this chapter a ceremony for any new initiates into their
coven  is  performed *end*  This  involved  blinding  binding  and  whipping  new  members  for  the
purpose of purification *end* However this ceremony is not as brutal as in medieval covens; they
are good witches so the whip they use now is said to be of embroidered silk *end* However those
present  with  sadomasochistic  tendencies  might  be  satisfied *end*  The  following  five-fold  kiss
bestowed by the High Priest or Priestess on the feet knees genitals breasts and lips of a new
member speaks for itself  *end*
       In  Man  Myth  and  Magic  An  Illustrated  Encyclopedia  of  the  Supernatural  Vol *end*    p *end*  Cavendish we read the following
   "Only three pieces of magic can be performed at each meeting they claim and the spells
should always be for the good; an evil spell rebounds threefold upon the head of its creator *end* Sometimes the spell is cast telepathically for instance in the case of a spell cast to cure a
person  of  a  bad  leg  the  witches  would  stand  silently  and  'will'  the  leg  to  heal *end*  On  other
occasions they might use a doll or 'fith-fath' to represent the sick person - bathe the doll's leg

they  say  have  much  wisdom  because

with a healing potion or the high priestess might 'bind' the spell wrapping her girdle around
the blade of her athame in a special way."
   How popular has this modern witchcraft become *end* In the September   Arkansas
Democrat "Family Weekly" Georgia Frontiere appeared on the front page *end* Georgia inherited
the Los Angeles Rams when her late sixth husband drowned in the riptides off the Florida
coast in April  *end* He was  *end* But what we really are interested in bringing to your attention
is her openness about being able says she to talk to her dead husband's spirit and how she
dabbles in the occult *end* On page  of the Sept *end*  issue we read the following "Georgia gives
Nolan  Cromwell  on  unasked  for  raise  .. *end*  and  Georgia  who  dabbles  in  the  occult  she  says
she's talked to Carroll's spirit mysteriously waves a hand at half-time over Haden's injured
leg which is believed to be broken *end*
   'I thought for sure she was nuts' Haden says *end* 'Then incredibly after the doctors told me
they were sure it was broken the X-rays were negative.' "
   Why are more and more people coming out publicly and admitting to be connected with
Spiritualism *end* About  years ago they would be afraid to make such statements for fear of
public ridicule and harm *end* However most Christians never heard of the Fraudulent Mediums
Act of  which only applies to those who obtain money from the public under the pretext
of  possessing  supernatural  power *end*  This  allows  those  who  really  can  perform  these  lying
wonders to practice their arts legally in the open for the first time in hundreds of years  *end*
     Most witches because they believe in the immortality of the soul teach that every human
being has a spirit guide that they can contact for advice *end* This is also where the Psychics claim
their  advice  and  information  comes  from *end*  These  departed  souls  they  say  are  the  spirits  of
loved ones ancient Indian Chiefs or Egyptian Hindu or Chinese Sages or Wise Men from
past  ages *end*  These  spirits
the  spirit  guides  have
experienced   many  reincarnations  and  have  mastered  the  lessons  they  were  meant  to  learn
while on earth and now have the power to benefit the livng  *end*
     As we already read from Scriptures the doctrine of "Life After Death" or the belief in an
immortal soul is a lie from the Devil *end* But the miracles and spells that some witches have are
very real *end* They may not know it but they receive their power from Devils who after they use
them to deceive other humans will destroy the very ones they have used *end*
    However  a  person  who  has  chosen  the  teachings  of  Jesus  Christ  and  made  His  Spirit  a
guide through a knowledge of the Scriptures knows that these spirit guides are not spirits of
past  Sages  but  spirits  of  devils impersonating them *end*  And  the  believer who has chosen the
God of the Bible is promised protection from those who practice Voodooism and spell casting *end* In Numbers  we read "Surely there is no ENCHANTMENT Witchery against Jacob
neither is there any DIVINATION against Israel."
     As established earlier the ancient pagans believed that when they died their souls flew up
to the Heavens and took possession of one of the stars *end* The chief gods of the Zodiac which
were but emanations of the Sun-god all HAD A SACRED NUMBER *end* Space does not allow
us to examine all of these numbers in Astrology *end* However to help us understand why this
mysterious number  was given to John the Apostle in Revelation  warning us not to
be identified with it it is necessary now to examine some ancient pagan numerology *end*
     Ancient Astrology teaches that one of the sacred numbers of the Chief god of the Zodiac
the sun was the number one *end* The Sun symbol we saw earlier was a Heavenly Bull and a
serpent *end* Since Babylon was the birth place of Astrology and the rest of Idolatry we will see
how this Babylonian system of gods and goddesses spread throughout the ancient world and
has penetrated into modern culture today *end*
       Originally  the  letters  of  the  various  alphabets  had  and  still  have  to  some  extent  a
numerical significance *end* The English language has lost track of this for there are no numbers
that  identify  with  each  letter  of  our  alphabet *end*  But  the  first  letter  of  the  alphabet  in  many
languages still carries with it a reference to the Sun-god one whose main symbol was either a

serpent or a bull *end* Take for instance the first letter in the Hebrew and Chaldee alphabet *end* It was
a symbol of a bull  *end*
     The Greek word aleph alpha is the name of the first letter in their alphabet and it means
bullor ox *end* It is interesting to note that the ever-revered bullgod of the Orient the elephant has
the  same  root  eleph  in  his  name  and  almost  every  Hindu  temple  has  its  phallic  idol  to
commemorate the lifegiving qualities of their god one *end* So to honour the Sun the god one
the Heavenly Bull-god the first day of the week  Sunday and the first of everything was
dedicated to the bull-god as sacred *end* The first day of the month the first day of the year the
first  born  son  and  the  first  fruits  of  the  harvest  and  of  the  flocks  were  kept  sacred  and
dedicated to him *end*
     Indeed most Christians cast away the original day of the worship described in Genesis -
 before Jews were ever heard of for the observance of Sunday the first day of the week *end* We will investigate this mystery later *end*
    The  number    in  ancient  Astrology  is  considered  a  female  number  and  a  symbol  for  the
Mother  goddess  who  according  to  pagan  belief  is  the  second  member  of  the  godhead *end* However pagan philosophy teaches that the number  was thought upon as an evil number *end* In
ancient paganism women were considered as evil and the cause of death *end* Some scholars claim
that our very word evil is eve-il *end*
     The name of the second letter of the Hebrew Chaldean alphabet is Beth a feminine proper
name  which  means  house *end*  The  moon  which  is  the  symbol  of  the  Mother  goddess  is  ever
considered as the monthly house of the Sun in Astrology *end*
     The number  is a sacred number identified with the pagan godhead of Baal Ishtar and
Tammuz *end* Sometimes the number  represented a triple aspect of the Sun-god as the ruler of
Heaven *end* While the sun appeared in the sky it was symbolized as a Heavenly Bull *end* The Serpent
was the symbol of the sun in the spiritual realm of things." However when the sun sinks into
the Western ocean at the end of the day and spends the night in the realm of darkness and the
dead  he
Babylonians Assyrians and Philistines was Dagon *end* This name Dagon like Kulkulcan of the
Mayans is derived by combining two words *end* Dag means Fish and On means Sun *end* Hence the
part man and part fish gods worshipped in the Old World *end* To the Romans he was Neptune
who was ever displayed in ancient Roman arts as part man part fish with a pitchfork in his
hand *end* It was during a festival to celebrate the capture of Samson and to give thanks to Dagon
for delivering Samson into the Philistines' hands that Samson pulled down the house in which
the Philistines were celebrating on himself and three thousand Philistines *end* Judges - *end*
     It is an interesting observation that the High Priest of Dagon wore a robe and a mitre that
resembled a fish *end* This mitre the pagan priests wore is the origin of the mitre the Popes and
Cardinals  wear  today *end*  This  mitre  that  resembles  a  fish  head  was  worn  centuries  before  the
birth of Christ by pagan High Priests of Dagon  *end*
     In India their trinity is based on the  phases of the Sun-god *end* When the sun rises in the
East he is Brahama when he gains his meridian he is Siva and when he sets in the West he
becomes  Vishnu *end*  This  explains  why  the  gods  of  the  orient  sometimes  were  displayed  with
three heads and three pairs of arms on one body *end* Many pagans believed in the three aspects of
the Sun-god who has  phases in which he travels across the sky *end* Hence the number  in
Astrology represents the trinity in Witchcraft *end*
     The number  is the sacred number in Astrology for the Sun as Ruler of the four quarters of
the Universe or the four divisions of the Zodiac the four seasons and the four directions *end* It is
interesting  to  note  the  name  of  Tammuz  where  the  cross  originally  came  from *end*  It  was
originally  the  initial  T  in  Tammuz  which  was  known  as  the  sacred  Tau *end*  The  cross  was  a
symbol of the sun worshippers centuries before Jesus was born *end* The number  itself is little
more than a cross *end* Take away the angular bar and we have a cross *end* As the reader probably has
observed no Catholic will pray a prayer or worship God until he makes the four directions

the  Underworld *end*  The  Fish-god

fish  god  Lord  of

to

the

then  becomes

the

across  his  head  and  body  to  resemble  it *end*  That  which  is  now  called  the  Christian  cross  was
originally the mystic Tau that the Chaldeans used to sacrifice a first born child to the Sun-god
 *end* And it was this very thing that was used to crucify Jesus on *end* No greater insult could
Satan give to Christ than to sacrifice Him on his own symbol of heathen worship *end*
     We have already explored some of the reasoning behind the number  in Astrology such as
the  pointed star Pentagram but it is the number  that should capture our close attention *end* The hidden meaning and symbols represented by the number  are so involved that an entire
book could be written about this number and its origin *end* Here again we explore the worship of
the serpent because the number SIX has ever been connected with the serpent *end*
     It is interesting to note that man and the serpent along with the other land animals were
created on the sixth day Genesis - *end* The words used to say SIX sex in Latin seis in
Spanish  seks  in  Norwegian  shest  in  Portuguese  sechs  in  German  and  sas  in  Chaldean-
Hebrew as in most languages start with the letter S *end* The letter S derived believe it or not
from a pictograph of a cobra erected in its striking position *end* The hissing sound of the letter S
represented the voice of the serpent *end* We can note that snake serpent and Satan begin with the
serpent  letter  S *end*  On  the  heads  of  cobras  there  are  usually  distinct  markings  in  the  shape  of
letters *end* They are V U and  *end* Hence the ancients invented names for different serpents with
these letters such as the U in Uraeus *end* That was the Egyptian name for their sacred Asp which
ever appears on the forehead or crown of the Pharoah who claimed to be the vicar or the
earthly incarnation of his god  *end*
     The O occurs in the Greek Ophis the name of the serpent whom the Gnostics worshipped *end* During  their  celebration  of  their  Lord's  Supper  they  let  a  snake  whom  they  called  Ophis
crawl over their bread *end* They became known in history as the Ophites  *end*
     In the Greek numerical system the symbol S is called the sigma and was originally the
sixth letter of the Greek alphabet *end* It was also represented as the number six *end* However today
the letter S or  sigma in Greek has a number significance of  *end* With the dropping of the
sacred sigma from the sixth position in the Greek alphabet it appears the Ethioptic and some
other alphabets did the same thing with their  letter *end* This has been one of the most baffling
mysteries to people who have studied into the origin of the alphabets *end* No one seems to know
why  the  ancients  did  this *end*  The  Z  or  Zeta  used  everywhere  to  stand  for    fell  into  the
position and is used in the mysteries of the occult for both  and  *end* Remember this because it
is important to know to be able to unlock secret symbols that hide or add to the number  *end* Why  should  so  much  importance  be  attached  to  this  number   *end*  The  answer  is  found  in
Revelation  that no man might buy or sell unless he identify with the Mark of the
Beast or the Name of the Beast or identify with the number of his Name  *end* This prophecy
is still future but if the reader is found identified with these things he or she will be destroyed
by Christ Himself *end* Revelation  *end* We will find the origin of this number of doom
shortly *end*
     The numbers  and  are often interchangeable *end* This confusion is probably where we get
our expression today "At sixes and sevens" a term meaning confusion *end* The Greek numerical
system  is  certainly  "At  sixes  and  sevens"  when  it  comes  to  these  two  numerical  symbols *end* When we study the origin of the number  we see that the number  stood from the time of
Babylon  on  for  the  Giant  Serpent  of  the  sky    whose    heads  were  a  symbol  of  the
fatecontrolling  planets  which  serpentine  their  way  through  the  Zodiac  in  the  Babylonian
astrological system *end* Here we begin to see why the Apostle John in the book of Revelation
symbolized Satan and his astrological religion as a seven headed serpent Dragon attacking
the woman which is a symbol of God's True Church *end* "And there appeared another wonder in
heaven;  and  behold  A  GREAT  RED  DRAGON  HAVING  SEVEN  HEADS  AND  TEN
HORNS and seven crowns upon his head." Revelation  *end*
   The Scriptures themselves show that the cosmic seven headed Dragon is a symbol of Satan *end* "And the GREAT DRAGON was cast out that OLD SERPENT called the Devil and Satan

which deceiveth the whole world He was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out
with him." Revelation  *end*
     Now in Revelation - we observed earlier that Mystery Babylon the Great the Mother
of Harlots is riding a Seven Headed Beast *end* However this is not a Dragon Devil but a beast
which in symbolic language represents a "Political Power." See Daniel -   and  *end*
We will study more about how a beast in Bible prophecy is a symbol of "Political Power"
further on *end*
     It will also be shown later on that this beast from the bottomless pit with seven heads and
ten horns is Satan's last political movement that will try to unite the world under one banner *end*
     As we already established the serpent was ever displayed in the pagan arts as an emblem
of the Sun-god *end* It is eye opening to learn that even many of the names used for the Sun-gods
actually add to  *end* For instance all the avatars incarnations of the Sun-god which were
ten according to the Hindu belief were called Buddhas or Rasees of the Siun or Sun *end* The
Greek word to describe the Buddhas or Rasees is Xiuv *end* This means Wisdom of the Sun or
Solar Wisdom *end* In the ancient Greek language this word to describe avatars of the Sun added
to   *end*
                                     X= I= U= N=  with a total of
     We will see more names of pagan gods that add to  as we go on *end* But first we need to
know more about the origin of the number  how some of our letters today derived from this
number and how letters were used in the Babylonian mysteries to hide the number  *end*
     We have noted that S is the initial of most words used for SIX *end* In several Greek dialects
the S was replaced by F which the Greeks called Bau Vau etc *end* If you take away the cross bar
on  F  it  too  resembles  a  snake  in  striking  position *end*  There  is  a  very  striking  resemblance
between S F and V *end* It can never be understood why the occultists used these letters in their
mysteries unless the reader remembers the S F and V represent the number SIX *end*  V is the
 letter in the Hebrew-Chaldean family of alphabets *end* F replaces it in Western alphabets and
it must be noted as stated before like  and  F and V are ever interchangeable *end* Take for
instance "knife" and "knives."
     Another letter that is a serpent symbol in Greek was the letter M *end* This letter represents in
the mysteries the number  and is the  letter of the Greek alphabet *end* M is frequently used
for the letter S because it is just a sigma on its side *end*
     Now if M is but a sigma on its side and refers to the second  or  letter it would
appear significant that the symbol for the letter following the sigma should be nothing more
than a Z or Zeth on its side *end* In the mysteries of paganism the second six M or the number
stands for the Zodiac *end* As we have seen the dropping of the sacred sigma as the sixth letter
numeral causes the Z to drop back into the sixth place *end* However like the letter S the Z also
resembles a hissing sound so the ancients never lost the significance of the number  *end*
     Now since history says our letters F M S V and Z derived from the ancient pictures of a
serpent in his striking position and have the numerical value of SIX in most other alphabets
we now might be able to understand the symbolic language *end*
     Just as a number in our present numerical system has place values such as  written alone
equals  six  two  sixes  together  equals  sixty-six  and  three  sixes  together  would  equal  six
hundred sixty-six so did the ancient learned doctors of witchcraft use the letters S V Z or the
other serpentine letters to hide the number  *end* Just as Freemasons have secret signs and grips
to let each other know they are Masons so did the learned doctors of witchcraft let each other
know who they were by camouflaging this sacred number  *end* Only the learned pagan knew
the significance *end* The number  was written in serpentine letters like SSS VVV ZZZ =  *end* They also arranged the letters different ways; sometimes they would turn them upside down or
sideways *end* The SSS sometimes could be seen with a line drawn through the middle of all three
S's and turned sideways *end* This is the origin of the popular amulet called the Oriental cross *end*
   Another way the number  was hidden which can be unmasked is in learning the origin

of the trident sign *end* Earlier we learned that the Sun-god's weapon was the lightning bolt and it
was stylized into a pitchfork *end* The pitchfork had three prongs to it hence we have today the
trident sign which by the way is used to symbolize the number  also *end*
     Beware of these schemes to deceive for it is still not clear how this number of doom
will keep God's people from buying and selling *end* It is not only the Mark of the Beast which we
will study in the last chapter that will prevent God's people from buying and selling but also
the number of his name  *end* Revelation   *end*
   However we can trace the origin of the number  *end* And this number of doom is derived
out of Astrology *end* The Zodiac is a narrow band about ° width making a complete circuit of
the sky around the earth *end* As we noted before this was symbolized in pagan arts by a serpent
with his tail in his mouth forming a circle *end* This represented to the occultist endless time or
eternal life  *end*
     As we established earlier astrology taught that the fate of mankind was ever decided by the
position of the stars *end* Now the chief gods of the Zodiac were the  planets who serpentined
their way through the  rooms of the Zodiac *end* The  planets travel through the narrow band of
the Zodiac at varying speeds *end* The Zodiacal band itself was divided into  houses one for
each month of the year and each house was divided into three rooms making  rooms in all
one  for  each  °  of  the  Zodiacal  circle"   *end*  Here  we  find  the  origin  of  our  present  time-
keeping *end* Believe it or not the dial of a clock is derived from the  houses of the Zodiac *end* Thus the Zodiac was a Heavenly Clock with which today we measure time *end* Here's another
interesting  fact  It  was  not  by  chance  that  our  ruler  has    inches  to  a  foot *end*  Both  of  these
systems of measuring time and length were based upon the  houses of the Zodiac *end* It was not
by chance we have  units to a dozen *end* Here we can find the origin of the "Chance of Fate." It
is not by chance that the original Roulette wheels have a " circle with  divisions of "
each with a blank or zero division to represent the  days beyond the  days in a year *end*
       It  is  not  by  chance  that  there  are    numbered  cards  in  a    card  deck *end*  One  card  each
represents the  weeks with  face cards four Kings four Queens and four Jacks and four
suits that represent the four seasons *end* Why do you suppose fortunetellers use a deck of cards to
predict the future *end* Because the deck of cards is derived from Astrology *end* Burn them *end*
     It is not by chance that our present townships are composed of  square miles for several
writers point out that the ancients divided the earth according to the divisions in the sky *end* Just
as truly as our  inch ruler was once a symbol of the  house Zodiac so is our  inch
yardstick based               upon the  rooms into which the heavenly houses were divided *end*
     Now the entire remainder of the sky outside of the Zodiacal band was also divided into
constellations  on the south side and  on the north side *end* A god of each constellation was
appointed to rule over one of the  rooms of the Zodiac *end* Every star in the sky was considered
as a god and the abode of departed spirits and was included in a constellation over whom was
appointed a god who ruled over a Zodiacal room *end* Each Zodiacal house god rules over a month
of the year and the  planetary gods regulated according to Astrology the affairs of mankind
by their relative positions in the various rooms of the Zodiac *end* Over them all ruled the Sun-god
The All-Seeing Eye who was considered the central fire from which each had sprung *end* As
you  will  recall  the  learned  doctors  of  paganism  believed  that  all  the  other  gods  were  but
emanations of the one god the Sun-god *end*
     Now      and  were the most sacred numbers in Astrology *end* Priests of Sun
worship used the numbers mathematically by the way the stars travel across the sky to predict
future events *end* They invented magic charts to perform this most popular form of divination *end* Like the Roulette wheel the charts were divided into  numbered divisions *end* There were
columns in all directions with the numbers  to  placed inside the entire chart *end* Any direction
you add the columns they add to  *end* There are six squares in each column and  =
 *end* If you add all the numbers from  to  they will also add to  *end* So you see the number
 was a sacred number that identified with the  room gods of the Zodiac and the number

 was a summary number of the Sun-god because it was his sacred number as the Ruler of
the Zodiac *end*
     Most will agree that this is very interesting but there is still another deeper deception the
Apostle John in the book of Revelation was told to warn the people of the world about *end* This
is the number of the Beast that will cause the world to worship Satan under a false system of
Christianity *end* "Take heed lest any man deceive you *end* For many shall come in my name saying
I am Christ; and shall deceive many." Mark  *end*
     "Here is wisdom *end* Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast for it is
the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred three-score and six." Revelation  *end*
     The Hebrew-Chaldean Latin Greek and Arab languages have a numerical value for the
letters of their alphabets *end* Take for instance the original Roman Numerals *end* They were I V X L
C D *end* And if you add these Roman Numerals themselves along with their numerical values we
get
                             I= V= X= L= C= D= with a total of
       The  letter  M  was  not  in  the  original  system  it  was  added  later *end*  Now  the  pagans  had  a
custom of adding their names according to the value of their letters of their own alphabet *end* As
their languages are different so were the values of each of their letters in their alphabets *end* The I
in Roman Numerals equals ; in the Greek language however the I has a value of  *end*
     The new Testament was originally written in the Greek language and an ancient Greek
name for Satan in its transliterations as we examined earlier was Teitan *end* And if you add Teitan
in its Greek numerical values for the letters we get
                           T= E= I= T= A= N= with a total of
       Now  since  the  Sun-god  the  Heavenly  Bull  brought  both  light  and  darkness  as  he  rose
from east to west he was worshipped also as both good and evil *end* He was worshipped not only
as  a  good  and  evil  god  but  both  male  and  female *end*  The  reasoning  behind  this  heathen
philosophy is that the Sungod was believed to be the source of all things *end* So since there is
good and evil and male and female the Sun-god had to be good and evil and double-sexed
because men and women were created in the image of their god *end* And since everything derived
from the Sun-god the ancients believed that the soul of man was a divine spark that returned
to the central fire the sun from which they originally came *end* And since the pagans believed
the stars were but emanations of the sun all the Star-gods were believed to be once men
that had visited this planet *end*
     This could explain why Quetzalcoatl the Mexican and Aztec messiah was pictured in their
arts as a good man who was a great benefactor of mankind *end* He visited the earth to teach the
arts of civilization and promised his followers he would return but he was pictured also as an
evil serpent which devoured mankind *end*
       The  American  Indians  both  in  the  North and  in  the  South  considered  the  bird  and  the
snake as sacred *end* The bird because of its power of flight contained the spirits of the dead and
was associated with lightning *end* Both lightning and birds of prey can be seen to descend sharply
from above and strike with lethal effectiveness  *end*
     Hence the mythological time-cycle bird of fire was called the Phoenix not only by many
Indian  tribes  of  North  America  but  also  by  the  Egyptians  and  the  Phoenicians *end*  Sometimes
called Benu by the Egyptians the Phoenix was worshipped as the bright and morning star *end* The  morning  star  to  the  Egyptians  was  the  nocturnal  representation  of  the  hidden  Sungod
Osiris or his soul *end* The Phoenix was known as "The One Who Ferries Osiris"  *end*
     In the earliest texts the morning star and Orion the ruler of the sky are often compared *end* For some gods with a similar name seem to be confused with the morning star like Athtar
who  was  worshipped  as  the  god  of  vegetation  as  was  Tammuz   *end*  However  this  name
Athtar according to Mythology of All Races means Lucifer  *end*
     Now it just so happens that one of the old spellings of Phoenix is Phenex or Fenex in
Greek transliterations *end* Like the name Lucifer Phoenix means "Shining One"  *end* And if we

add FENEX in its Greek value we get
                             F= E= N= E= X= with a total of
     It depended on what area of the world the pagan lived as to what type of bird was called
the Phoenix *end* To the Egyptian it was the heron *end* To the Babylonians Assyrians and Hindus it
was  peacock *end*  To  the  North  American  Indian  it  was  the  Eagle *end*  To  the  Central  and  South
American he was the quetzal *end*
     In China Japan and India the phoenix is the peacock and the symbol of the sun *end* In Bali the
peacock is a symbol of the entire sky  *end* The pagan believed that when he died his spirit
soul would become immortal and take possession of one of the stars in Heaven from whence
he originally came  *end* It is significant that the Peacock Throne made at Delhi India in
is  supported  by    pillars  one  for  each  of  the    signs  of  the  Zodiac *end*  It  is  eye  opening  to
discover the Peacock Sun-bird a symbol of Lucifer the god behind all false gods pictured on
a Roman Catholic Church window encircled by the Zodiac *end* In the church of St *end* Maurice at
Reims  France  we  find  a  woman  probably  the  Virgin  Mary  pictured  in  a  sun-halo  and
crowned with seven stars *end* In one hand she holds a peacock around which stretches a circular
band  having  on  it  the    signs  of  the  Zodiac *end*  Another  shocking  observation  regarding  the
Roman Catholic Church is her exaltation of her Pope when in procession as he is carried on
his portable throne *end* During this procession two grooms carry large fans of peacock feathers in
such  a  way  that  the  seated  Pope  seems  to  have  two  wings  on  his  shoulders  which  are
constantly in motion and they make him appear as if he is flying *end*
     In ancient Rome and Greece heaven was considered filled with eyes the eyes representing
the  stars  the  stars  representing  the  homes  of  the  dead *end*  The  god  Argus  was  said  to  have
hundreds  of  eyes   *end*  These  eyes  of  Heaven  were  represented  by  the  eyes  found  on  the
peacock feathers *end*
     June Queen of Heaven to the Romans had a peacock as her sacred bird  *end* The peacock
or Phoenix has long been connected with the Zodiac *end* The Yezidis the open Devil worshippers
we  mentioned  earlier  to  this  day  have  seven  stone  images  of  peacocks  which  they  say
represent  the    planets  and  which  they  call  Seitan  which  is  merely  the  Arabic  spelling  for
Teitan or Satan *end*
       In  Hinduism  the  Ramayana  relates  that  when  the  god  Indra  transforms  himself  into  an
animal he becomes a peacock *end* In India the peacock was believed to have a thousand eyes in
its feathers and had power to kill snakes  *end* This sacred bird that symbolized the heavenly
host  is  known  to  have  been  kept  in  Babylon  for  religious  purposes *end*  Aristotle  mentions  the
peacock bird and a reference in a play by Aristophanes may imply that a Persian ambassador
brought a gift of peacocks *end* Alexander the Great imposed heavy penalties on those who killed
Indian peacocks *end* The birds were depicted on Greek coins *end* They were sacred to Hera and a
myth relates how the goddess set the hundred eyed Argus to guard her husband's mistress Io
after Zeus sent Hermes to charm and kill Argus *end* Hera used the giant's eyes to ornament the
peacock's  tail   *end*  In  Java  the  peacock  was  associated  with  the  Devil   *end*  In  Mosul  in
northern Iraq there is a sect of Yezidis who hold that the Devil is not evil and call him the
Peacock Angel *end* The worshippers of Satan could have chosen no better animal to represent the
heavenly host as the proud ruler of the year and god behind all gods *end*
     It is interesting to note that the very symbol of the proud ruler of the universe according to
heathen belief is used as a symbol for the NBC Television Network *end* And CBS Television
Network uses the "All-Seeing Eye" which was the symbol of the Sungod  the Ruler of the
eyes stars in heaven *end* Also ABC Television Network uses the Sun-disk as a symbol of their
organization *end*
       It  is  very  important  that  the  reader  have  some  knowledge  of  the  various  religions  that
derived out of Astrology so that he may understand the esoteric mysteries found in the goals
and  purposes  of  Secret  Societies *end*  However  before  we  begin  to  study  the  Secret  Societies
which we shall examine in the next chapter there are a couple of more important facts about

astrology and spiritualism the reader should be aware of *end*
     Astrology teaches that this world is to pass through a time period about  years *end* This
is the length of time it takes according to astrology for the Earth to pass through the influence
of each of the twelve signs of the Zodiac *end* Each Great Month or Sign is figured about
years."'
     Hence the entire time period of Twelve Months having about  years each is known
to  astrologers  as  The  Great  Year *end*  This  Great  Year  is  divided  by  seven  ages  Leo  Cancer
Gemini Taurus Aries Pisces and Aquarius  *end*
     During this so-called Great Year or  years astrology claims to have predicted the
evolutionary  progress  of  man  from  century  to  century *end*  The  starting  point  for  the  seven
continual Ages began - BC which was known as the Age of Leo *end* From the book
"The Compleat Astrologer" Parker we read the following
   "The earliest Month of which we have real knowledge was that of Leo  -  B.C *end*
The Lascaux cave paintings show the Leonine creative influence but the thought-motivation
behind the effort is Aquarian in spirit *end* The Age of Cancer  -  B.C *end* witnessed the
earliest  development  of  settled  farming  and  constructed  dwellings  -
both  of  which  are
Capricornian in essence *end* During the Geminian Age  -  B.C *end* the founding of the
earliest libraries comes under Sagittarius *end* Perhaps the most striking polarity of all was in the
Taurean Age  -  B.C *end* for the Egyptians were much preoccupied with death and the
afterlife  themes  strongly  related  to  Scorpio *end*  The  war-like  Arian  Age  expressed  its  polarity
with Libra in the magnificent beauty and balance of Greek Architecture B.C *end* - Birth of
Christ." The Compleat Astrologer Parker McGraw-Hill Book Company  p *end*  *end*
     Now according to Astrology we are living in the Age of Pisces O -  A.D. *end* The Age
of Pisces is considered the Christian dispensation *end* Pisces was symbolized in Astrology in the
form of a fish because the Mother goddess Venus and Cupid hurled themselves into the river
Euphrates and became fishes after being terrified by the giant Typhon  *end* Hence we find the
real origin of the fish symbol that some erring Christians display to show they are Christians *end*      Spiritualism teaches that during this evolutionary time table of the  years Masters of
Wisdom or Christs were to arise *end* Some were to be founders of great religions say occultists
and they would have a variety of titles such as Mahatmas the Hierarchy the Great Ones the
Secret Brotherhood the Inner Government of the World the Great White Lodge of Masters of
the Wisdom *end* One of these socalled Masters was Koot Hoomi who is said to have inspired a
witch named Alice Bailey  *end* She claimed to be one of these Masters  *end*
     She was the author of many occult books one of which was Discipleship in the New Age *end* In her book she states the following
   "We stand now on the verge of a similar but still more momentous event - the appearance of
the  fifth  kingdom  as  a  result  of  the  planned  activity  of  the  New  Group  of  World  Servers
working in collaboration with the Hierarchy of perfected souls and under the guidance of the
Christ  Himself *end*  This  will  usher  in  the  New  Age  wherein  five  kingdoms  in  nature  will  be
recognized as existing side by side upon earth." Discipleship in the New Age Bailey Lucis
Publishing Co *end*  p *end*  *end*
     Bailey goes on to say that this New Age we are entering into will call for a universal New
World  Religion   *end*  This  philosophy  is  based  on  the  theory  found  in  Astrology  that  this
world is entering into the Age of Aquarius *end* Hence the  reader may look at this song found
among Rock 'N Rollers in a different light *end* For "This is the dawning of the Age of Aquarius"
was written by disciples of this New Age Movement to help promote the idea of a One World
Government and a One World Religion *end*
     Now Aquarius is also known as the great coming New Month *end* In the book The Compleat
Astrologer Parker p *end*  we read the following
   "In the Age of Aquarius we may conjecture that man will consider a system of  WORLD
GOVERNMENT which will involve the organizational characteristics of Leo."

     Alice Bailey told her brethren that Christ Himself would usher in this New Age *end* Bailey
goes on to say how this New Age will call for a New World Religion *end* In her book Disciples in
the New Age p *end*  we read the following
    "The  Workers  in  the  Field  of  Religion  form  this  group *end*  Their  work  is  to  formulate  the
universal platform of the NEW WORLD RELIGION *end* It is a work of loving synthesis and it
will emphasize the unity and the fellowship of the spirit *end* This group is in a pronounced sense
a channel for the second Ray of Love-Wisdom that of the World Teacher - an office held at
present  by  the  Christ *end*  The  platform  of  the  NEW  WORLD  RELIGION  will  be  built  by  the
many groups working under the inspiration of the Christ and the influence of the second ray
and these - in their totality - will constitute this sixth group."
     Reader be not deceived *end* The Christ here that Alice Baily is referring to is  NOT JESUS
OF NAZARETH *end* Spiritualism does not deny the existence of Jesus but they do deny Jesus
was  God  Manifested  in  the  Flesh *end*  And  as  we  continue  to  follow  the  history  of  the  Great
Luciferian  Conspiracy  the  reader  will  see  how  Spiritualism  uses  Christianity  to  destroy
Christianity *end* We may examine this fact by reading the writings of another disciple of this New
Age Movement who called himself Levi *end* In his book The Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ
Levi  shows  how  Spiritualism  is  trying  to  unite  Christianity  into  its  ranks  which  untold
millions have already been deceived by
   "The Christ is son the only son begotten by Almighty God the GOD OF FORCE and God
omniscient God of thought; and Christ is God the God of Love *end* " Levi goes on to say
   "Christ is the Logos of Infinities and through the word alone are thought and Force made
manifest." The Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ Levi DeVorss & Co *end* Publishers  *end*      Spiritualism teaches that Jesus was just one of the Masters that would come into the world *end* And the word Christ in Spiritualism is a principle Logos and does not refer to any particular
person  *end* Jesus was just another avatar  among modern day occultists *end*
     Again we quote from The Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ by Levi as follows
     "What relationship existed between Jesus of Nazareth and the Christ *end* Orthodox Christian
ecclesiastics tell us that Jesus of Nazareth and the Christ were one; that the true name of this
remarkable person was Jesus Christ *end* They tell us that this man of Galilee was the very eternal
God clothed in flesh of man that men might see his glory *end* Of course this doctrine is wholly at
variance with the teachings of Jesus Himself and of His apostles." The Aquarian Gospel of
Jesus the Christ Levi De Vorss & Co *end* Pub *end*  pp *end*   *end*
     Contrary to what Levi said in his book there are numerous Scriptures found in the Bible
both in the Old and New Testament that supports the doctrine that Jesus was God Himself
clothed in a human body *end* "And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness God
was manifest in the flesh justified in the Spirit seen of angels preached unto the Gentiles
believed on in the world received up into glory." .Timothy  *end*
     Jesus Himself said in John  "Philip saith unto him Lord shew us the Father and it
sufficeth us *end* Jesus saith unto him HAVE I BEEN SO LONG TIME WITH YOU AND YET
HAST THOU NOT KNOWN ME PHILIP *end* HE THAT HATH SEEN ME HATH SEEN THE
FATHER; and how sayest thou then shew us the Father?"
     Here is another truth the Scriptures call to attention *end* "Who is a liar but he that denieth that
Jesus is the Christ *end* He is antichrist that denieth the Father and the Son." .John  *end* "And
every spirit that confesseth NOT that Jesus Christ is come IN THE FLESH IS NOT OF GOD
and this is that SPIRIT OF ANTICHRIST whereof ye have heard that it should come; and
even now already is it in the world." .John  *end*
     Spiritualism teaches that at the beginning of every Age there has been a Christ to usher
them in *end* Jesus was the Christ who according to Astrology ushered in the Age of Pisces O -
  A.D. *end*  Today  Spiritualism  calls  Christ  "The  God  of  Force."  Little  do  these  modern
Luciferians  know  that  the  Christ  of  the  Holy  Scriptures  the  Lord  of  the  Sabbath  foretold
through  His  Prophets  how  Spiritualism  would  try  to  unite  the  world  into  a  One  World

Luciferian Socialistic Government *end* The Apostle John was given a vision from our Lord Jesus
of Nazareth that symbolized this New Age Movement as the Beast that ascendeth out of the
Bottomless Pit *end* Revelation ;  - *end* While Daniel the Prophet was given a vision of
this New Age Movement almost  years before the Apostle John of Revelation received his
vision *end* Daniel even used the same language modern Luciferians and occultists use today to
describe it *end* In Daniel - we read the following "And the king shall do according to his
will;  and  he  shall  exalt  himself  and  magnify  himself  above  every  god  and  shall  speak
marvellous
indignation  be
accomplished for that which is determined shall be done *end* Neither shall he regard the God of
his fathers nor the desire of women nor regard any god for he shall magnify himself above
all *end* But in his estate shall he honour the GOD OF FORCES and a god whom his fathers knew
not shall he honour with gold and silver and with precious stones and pleasant things *end* Thus
shall  he  do  in  the  most  strong  holds  with  a  strange  god  whom  he  shall  acknowledge  and
increase with glory; and he shall cause them to rule over many and shall divide the land for
gain." In the following chapters of this book we will understand more of the meaning of this
prophecy and we will learn what other names this New Age Movement is coming under *end*

     To trace the origin and purposes of Secret Societies we need to go back again to the book
of  the  beginnings  Genesis  to  Adam  and  Eve's  fall *end*  The  book of  Genesis  showed  us  how
Satan caused a serpent to deceive Eve then later managed to get the very instrument used to
deceive to be worshipped and adored *end* Now in this chapter we will study the bait Satan used to
actually induce the first humans to commit their deadly mistake and how Lucifer has used
this same bait to deceive others *end*
       What  did  the  Father  of  Lies  say  unto Eve *end*  "For  God  doth  know that  in  the  day  ye  eat
thereof  then  your  eyes  shall  be  opened  and  ye  shall  be  as  gods  knowing  good  and  evil."
Genesis  *end*
     Here is the Truth about how multitudes are swept into the high ranks of Witchcraft to be
used by Satan to deceive others *end* It was by creating a desire to obtain forbidden knowledge that
Adam and Eve were swept from the protection of God and lost eternal life not only for them
but also their offspring *end* Satan implanted in Adam and Eve a desire to be like gods knowing
good  and  evil *end*  This  covetousness  produced  self-exaltation  in  the  minds  of  the  earth's  first
couple and it is this very thing that led to Lucifer's own fall in Heaven *end*
       Man  from  the  time  of  Adam  and  Eve  has  ever  strived  to  progress  forward  into  the
knowledge of the secret things of the Universe *end* As with Adam and Eve Lucifer tries to kindle
a desire to explore what God has not made known to us *end* The Bible reveals to man there are
secrets  of  the  Universe  the  Lord  does  not  want  to  reveal  to  man *end*  It  is  not  because  God  is
selfish as the serpent implied but because of the evil heart in man - he can't be trusted with
them *end*  Look  at  the  condition  that  man  has  created  for  himself  in  the  world  today *end*  He  is
constantly in fear world wide because of his evil inventions that could destroy the world *end* He
is plagued day by day with the threat of war crime and national ruin within his own country *end* It was Christ who created the Universe and all that is in them *end* John - ; Ephesians ;
Hebrews   *end*  Jesus  is  the  owner  and  it's  His  right  to  judge  what  knowledge  man  can  or
cannot be trusted with *end* Saith the Lord "The secret things belong unto the Lord our God but
those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever that we may do all
the words of this law." Deuteronomy  *end*
       How  were  these  secrets  about  the  Earth's  history  revealed *end*  Saith  the  Lord  "Surely  the
Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto His servants the prophets." Amos

 *end* For those things that were to be revealed to us God chose people that he knew he could
trust  and  would  faithfully  carry  out  His  prescriptions *end*  These  people  were  called  Prophets *end* They were to write down and record what was revealed to them by Visions and Dreams *end*
     Saith the Lord "And he said hear now my words If there be a prophet among you I the
Lord will make myself known unto him in a VISION and will speak unto him in a dream."
Numbers  *end*
     However as there is a Mystery of Godliness .Timothy  so is there a Mystery of
Iniquity .Thessalonians  *end* And as the Lord has His Prophets so has the Devil *end* "For such
are false apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ *end* And
no  marvel;  for  Satan  himself  is  transformed  into  an  angel  of  light *end*  Therefore  it  is  no  great
thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be
according to their works." .Corinthians - *end*
     Now one of the clear ways to test a prophet is found in Isaiah  "To the Law and to the
Testimony  if  they  speak  not  according  to  this  word  it  is  because  there  is  NO  LIGHT  IN
THEM."  If  a  man  or  woman  claims  to  receive  a  vision  or  a  dream  from  the  Lord  but
contradict  the  teaching  in  the  Law  Torah  which  means  the  first  five  books  of  the  Bible
Genesis Exodus Leviticus Numbers Deuteronomy or contradicts the teachings found in
the Testimony the rest of the books of the Bible it is because the Lord has not sent them *end* Another  way  the  Lord  has  given  His  people  to  detect  a  true  or  false  prophet  is  found  in
Deuteronomy - "If there arise among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams and giveth
thee a sign or a wonder And the sign or the wonder come to pass whereof he spake unto thee
saying Let us go after other gods which thou hast not known and let us serve them; thou
shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams for the Lord your
God proveth you to know whether ye love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all
your soul *end* Ye shall walk after the Lord your God and fear him and keep his commandments
and obey his voice and ye shall serve him and cleave unto him *end* And that prophet or that
dreamer of dreams shall be put to death because he hath spoken to turn you away from the
Lord  your  God  which  brought  you  out  of  the  land  of  Egypt  and  redeemed  you  out  of  the
house of bondage to thrust thee out of the way which the Lord thy God commanded thee to to
walk in *end* So shalt thou put the evil away from the midst of thee *end* "
     As stated clearly above the Lord said there are some people who can predict something to
happen give a sign or can work wonders but at the same time could be trying to lead us into
the worship of one of these religions of Satan's we have been examining *end* Can we not today in
our time observe such things *end*
     Here is another way the Lord gives His people knowledge and understanding to see who is
being led by the Holy Spirit or being used by the Devil *end* "I have also spoken by the prophets
and I have multiplied visions and used similitudes by the ministry of the prophets *end* And by a
prophet  the  Lord  brought  Israel  out  of  Egypt  and  by  a  prophet  was  he  preserved."  Hosea
  *end* A true prophet's ministry will tend to preserve the people *end*
    When  a  man  or  woman  claims  to  receive  a  message  from  the  Lord  about  something  to
happen but it doesn't the Bible warns "But the prophet which shall presume to speak a word
in my name which I have not commanded him to speak or that shall speak in the name of
other gods even that prophet shall die *end* And if thou say in thine heart How shall we know the
word which the Lord hath not spoken *end* When a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord if
the thing follow not nor come to pass that is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken but
the  prophet  hath  spoken  it  presumptuously  thou  shalt  not  be  afraid  of  him."  Deuteronomy
- *end*
     A genuine prophet of God is distinguished from a false prophet according to Scripture by
his  life  Doctrines  Predictions  and  who  he  or  she  worships *end*  If  a  prophet  predicts  certain
events to happen and only some of the events come to pass it is because he is not receiving
messages from the Lord *end* A genuine prophet of God according to Scripture is never wrong in

thy

counsels  Let

of

the  Astrologers

predicting future events because the messages he is receiving are from the One who knows
the end of things from the beginning *end* A prophet who foretold something to the Lord's people
in ancient times but that prediction did not come to pass was to be killed for deceiving the
people *end*
     Now here is another important note from the Scriptures to remember in testing prophets
"There  shall  not  be  found  among  you  any  one  that  maketh  his  son  or  his  daughter  to  pass
through fire or that useth divination or an observer of times or an enchanter or a witch or a
charmer or a consulter with familiar spirits spirit guides or a wizard or a necromancer *end* For
all that do these things are an abomination unto the Lord and because of these abominations
the Lord thy God doth drive them out from thee." Deuteronomy - *end*
       The  God  of  the  Bible  says  He  communicates  to  His  Prophets  through  VISIONS   AND
DREAMS *end* He does not reveal messages through Astrologers Palm Readers or through cards
or  by  crystal  ball  visions *end*  This  is  prophecy  by  divination *end*  He  does  not  reveal  messages
through  a  magician  sorcerer  or  psychic *end*  The  Lord  does  not  reveal  messages  through  a
hypnotist  called  a  charmer  in  Scripture *end*  The  Lord  does  not  relay  messages  through  spirit
guides which the psychics mediums and witches claim to be ancient sages or wise men *end* "The
dead know not any thing."  Ecclesiastes  *end* The Lord does not communicate through wizards
male witches or necromancers "For all that do these things are an ABOMINATION UNTO
THE LORD." Deuteronomy  *end*
   As  we  tried  to  show  you  in  the  last  chapter  Astrology  is  the  basic  foundation  of

Witchcraft *end* In Isaiah the Bible foretells what will happen to Astrologers and people who trust
in them *end* Unlike Astrology the Bible predictions have never failed "Thou art wearied in the
multitude
the  monthly
Prognosticators stand up and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee behold
they shall be as stubble the fire shall burn them they shall not deliver themselves from the
power  of  the  flame  there  shall  not  be  a  coal  to  warm  at  nor  fire  to  sit  before  it."  Isaiah
 *end*
     "Remember the former things of old for I am God and there is none else I am God and
there is none like me declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times the things
that are not yet done saying My counsel shall stand and I will do all my pleasure *end* " Isaiah
 *end*
       Our  Lord  from  ancient  times  has  revealed  the  mysteries  of  the  Godhead  and  what  he
desires us to know about the Universe and its future through His Holy Prophets *end* However
instead of believing these words "Believe in the Lord your God so shall ye be established;
believe his prophets so shall ye prosper" .Chronicles  Satan has led man away from
the Gospel by keeping him interested in the secrets of the Universe *end* While abandoning the
most ancient book we have about the world's history the Bible men are led to think there is
Truth  beyond  Bible  Truth  and  have  invented  false  sciences  which  totally  contradict  the
Scriptures *end* The way out speculations and pure guess work used to support their findings leads
them to eventually lose hold on what little faith they had in God to even reject that there is a
God *end*
     When the Jews were deceived into worshipping the cosmic gods of nature and were sent
into captivity by the Lord to Babylon as a punishment for their idolatry certain Jewish priests
while  in  Babylon  studied  deep  into  the  ancient  Babylonian  mysteries  Witchcraft *end*  These
priests produced what became a philosophy called the Cabala Cabbala or Qabbalah some of
the  English  spellings  of  a  Hebrew  word  whose  more  correct  transliteration  is  Kabbalah
whose meaning is "Receiving" or "that which is received." The Cabala's central doctrine say
the Cabalists deals with the unfolding of the hidden and unknowable God into the fullness of
the manifest God known by his works  *end* In other words they try to explain that which is
hidden that the Lord has not revealed *end* The scientific name for this science is Metaphysics *end* The
word  Cabala  actually  derived  from  the  Hebrew  verb  kabel  which  means  to  receive  and

the  Stargazers

the  Cabalists  believe

that

   Unlike  ancient  Witchcraft

teaches  but  a  complex  organism  consisting  of

implies that the Cabala was received in the form of special revelations by a few of the elect
who were especially chosen for the privilege because of their saintliness  *end*
       This  Jewish  movement  didn't  catch  on  among  the  Jews  as  a  whole  until  about  nine
centuries after the resurrection of Christ *end* It reached its height in Spain when a Cabalist's Bible
called the Zohar was published  *end* The Zohar was compiled by Moses de Leon at the end of
the    century *end*  He  incorporated  into  the  Zohar  which  means  "book  of  brightness"  the
doctrines  of  the  infamous  Gnostics  and  Neoplatonists    that  the  soul  is  immortal  and  its
attachment to the body is unfortunate but temporary *end* Cabalists believe in reincarnation and
that God supplies all knowledge *end* They claim that the Scriptures contain important symbols
that properly analyzed reveal secrets concerning the creation of the Universe *end* They believed
that these secret combinations of words and symbols could be manipulated to achieve magical
results  *end*

the  Godhead  consists  of
emanations  of  the  one  God *end*  However  these  Jewish  Cabalists  do  not  believe  that  these
emanations  are  gods  as  paganism
ten
emanations  potencies  or  focal  points  called  the  Sefiroth *end*  These  ten  aspects  stages  or
manifestations of the Living Deity the World of Emanation or World of the Sefiroth is not
the Universe stars say Cabalists but the Godhead in its existent aspect  *end*
     It is mind boggling to try to understand any of this nonsense; however we ask the reader to
keep  patience  for  the  reader  must  have  a  little  knowledge  what  the  Cabala  is  so  he  can
understand  the  philosophies  behind  the  Secret  Societies *end*  It  is  from  the  Cabala  that  modern
Witchcraft and the Secret Societies say they draw many of their crafts *end*
     Like Witchcraft the Cabala teaches that man is a microcosm miniature universe and has
both male and female elements in the Godhead *end* The female element of the Godhead is found
in  one  of  the  ten  emanations  Sefiroth *end*  The  Shekhinah  they  say  is  the  female  element
because  it  is  the  passive  aspect  to  the  Deity  the  manifestation  of  the  divine  power  which
vitalizes all creation  *end*
     Cabalists say man has spiritual intercourse with God through the Shekhinah *end* From Hasidic
Prayer by Louis Jacobs page  we quote the following
       "But  of  Moses  of  the  Zohar  does  say  that  he  had  intercourse  with  the  SHEKHINAH *end* Tishby has however shown that there are in fact many passages in the Zohar in which erotic
symbolism is used for man's relationship with God and not only with regard to Moses." Jacobs
goes on to say "For instance the Zohar states that when a man cannot be with his wife for
example when he is away from home or when he is studying the Torah or when she has her
periods then the Shekhinah is with him so that he can be male and female."
     Another sacrilegious claim of the Cabala is also found in their philosophy about the
emanations Sefiroth *end* Cabalists claim that the  Sefiroth is the Tree of Life from which the
Universe emanated or came into existence and that man can unite himself with or become
the One 'by rising through the spheres' spiritually climbing the ladder of the Sefiroth to reach
God  *end* In magic the adept an expert must experience and master all  Sefiroth in order to
achieve supreme perfection and power for the Tree of the Sefiroth is believed to be a cosmic
diagram the basic pattern which shows how the Universe is arranged and how its phenomena
are connected *end* And since man is a miniature replica of the Universe microcosm and of God
man is capable of spiritually expanding himself to become God  *end*
     Is not this blasphemous language nothing but an echo from Eden *end* "YE SHALL BE AS
GODS"  Genesis   *end*  The  Cabala
the
Omnipotent God *end* Who would dare make such a statement *end* As we saw earlier his words are
recorded in Isaiah - *end*
       Like  Roman  Catholic  Church  doctrines  there  are  enormous  amounts  of  blasphemous
claims against the God of Heaven that can be found in their literature *end* However space does
not allow us to venture too far into this diabolical scheme to deceive *end* But to summarise what

the  magnitude  of

teaches

that  man  can

reach

basically the Cabala is it can be summed up in one word MAGIC and its roots are found in
Babylon *end*  Cabalistic  magic  is  mainly  arranging  numbers  and  combining  Hebrew  letters  and
their numerical values into magical squares and anagrams  *end*
       The  Cabalists  claimed  Moses  used  magic  to  bring  the  plagues  against  the  Egyptians *end* However  it  wasn't  Moses  who  caused  the  plagues  to  fall  upon  the  Egyptians  it  was  God
Himself *end* There will be more unveiling of the Cabala and how multitudes have been deceived
by it as we study into the doctrines and purposes of the Secret Societies *end* However before we
study the origin and purposes of the Secret Societies we need to examine an ancient mystical
name  given  to  schools  or  groups  that  taught  Babylonian  mysticism *end*  They  were  known  for
centuries as the Illuminati *end*  And they called Babylonian mysticism ILLUMINISM *end*
     The Encyclopedia Americana p *end*  says The Illuminati is a name taken or given to
various groups of individuals existing during the past  years who believed in and taught
a  doctrine  of  illumination  or  inner  light  Illuminism   *end*  However  this  mystical  name
derived from its original source at a much earlier time *end* The Western equivalent to this Eastern
mysticism is Hermeticism and Gnosticism which we will also examine as we go on *end*
     The Illuminati taught living a life of purity and service would open their so-called inner
senses  so  that  they  would  obtain  spiritual  sight  or  Clairvoyance  known  as  the  Third  Eye
become Seers and be able to converse with angels and with dead saints  *end* The individual
who became spiritually or intellectually enlightened in the ancient Babylonian Mysteries was
initiated into the mysteries when qualified and called an Illuminated  *end*
   In France under the name of Illumines another Witchcraft school appeared in Picardy in
 but only continued a short time because of the repressive measures taken by the Papacy *end* However  another  sect  of  Illumines  appeared  in  the  south  of  France  about    AD  and
continued until  *end* They traced their origin to the Gnostics  *end*
       Here  is  an  interesting  note *end*  It  is  from  a  sect  of  the  Illuminati  who  existed  in  the
century  that  the  Rosicrucians  an  international  Secret  Society  claim  their  modern  fraternal
order  originated *end*  They  also  continue  to  claim  that  it  actually  derived  out  of  the  Egyptian
mysteries before that time *end* Rosicrucism is a mixture of both Christianity and Witchcraft *end*
     The number  in Witchcraft plays a very important part in the practice of Witchcraft as
we saw earlier *end* And so it does in this fraternal Order of the Rosicrucians *end* Here from one of
their own publications "The Rosicrucian Cosmo - Conception" by Max Heindel we read the
following
     "The Order is not merely a secret society; it is one of THE MYSTERY SCHOOLS and the
Brothers  are  Hierophants  of  the  lesser  Mysteries  Custodians  of  the  Sacred  Teachings  and
spiritual  power  more  potent
the  visible
Governments though they may not interfere with humanity so as to deprive them of their free
will."
Heindel goes on to say
       "Like  all  other  Mystery  Orders  the  Order  of  Rosicrucians  IS  FORMED  ON  COSMIC
LINES If we take balls of even size and try how many it will take to cover one and hide it
from view we shall find it will require  to conceal a thirteenth ball *end* The ultimate division of
physical matter the true atom found in interplanetary space is thus grouped in twelve around
one *end* The twelve signs of the Zodiac enveloping our Solar System the twelve semitones of the
musical scale comprising the octave the twelve Apostles who clustered around Christ etc *end* are  other  examples  of  this  grouping  of    and   *end*  The  Rosicrucian  Order  is  therefore  also
composed of  Brothers and a ."
     We will come back to the Rosicrucians in a moment but let's go on and take another look
at  some  other  Mystic  Schools  who  adopted  this  name  "Illuminati."  There  were  other  little
sects of Illuminism recorded in history like the Illuminati of Avignon and the Illuminati of
Stockholm;  but  none  of
liberty  of  conscience  and
Christianity like the Illuminati of Bavaria *end* This Secret Order was founded May   by

the  Western  World

them  became  a

   Now

the  Rosicrucians  who  claim  also

to  be

and  mixed

illuminated  or  Enlightened  say

from  whom  Simon  Magus  borrowed  his  mysteries

one  Adam  Weishaupt  a  professor  of  Canon  Law  at  Ingolstadt  Germany  and  an  ex-Jesuit
priest." Weishaupt and his Order of Illuminati we shall study in the next chapter *end*

that
Thutmose III of Egypt was the founder of their Secret Order *end* He erected two obelisks bearing
a record of his achievements *end* One of these obelisks is now located in Central Park in New
York  *end*
     According to the Rosicrucians after Thutmose III died his son Amenhotep took up his
father's work in their Brotherhood about the end of September  BC *end* He was succeeded by
his  son  Thutmose  IV  who  ruled  from    to    BC *end*  Then  came  Amenhotep  IV  with
whose  history  all  the  Rosicrucians  are  greatly  concerned *end*  He  was  the  Great  Master  in  the
family of the founders and the one to whom they owe their philosophies and writings used so
universally in all their Lodge work throughout the world *end* He was born in the Royal Palace at
Thebes according to the Rosicrucians in  BC  *end*
     To qualify to be initiated into the mysteries the new initiate had to want to become an
expert adept in Astrology Magic Sorcery Fortune-telling Necromancy etc *end* which by the
way is an abomination unto our Lord Deuteronomy - *end*
     On this side of the resurrection of Jesus Christ there were various other schools of these
mystics besides the ones we already stated who were given or assumed this name Illuminati
on the grounds of having superior knowledge of God and of divine things which they claimed
to be able to perform *end* The Rosicrucians and the Illuminati's first cousins were the infamous
Gnostics
them  with
Christianity *end*  Another  group  of  Gnostics  found  in  the  book  of  Revelation  were  called  the
Nicolaitanes Revelation  who were followers of one Nicolas a deacon in the time of
Paul who fell into licentious doctrines and practices  *end*
     Another such school for higher learning of Witchcraft was found in Spain around
AD and was called in the native language Los Alumbrados *end* It continued for about a century
then  disappeared  as  victim  of  the  Spanish  Inquisition *end*  Ignatius  Loyola  the  founder  of  the
Society of Jesus the Jesuits almost became a victim of the Spanish Inquisition himself when
the  Roman  Catholic  Church  got  wind  of  his  connection  with  the  Alumbrados *end*  But  he  was
acquitted before the Inquisition Court with an admonition  *end*
       However  there  are  some  who  hold  today  that  the  Illuminati  is  a  front  for  the  Roman
Catholic  Church  to  unite  the world under her banner again *end* And it was this same Ignatius
Loyola  who  founded  the  Illuminati   *end*  But  we  will  learn  from  history  that  it  was  not
Ignatius  Loyola  who  founded  the Order  of  the  Illuminati  in  Germany  which  has  continued
since  AD *end* It was Adam Weishaupt an ex-Jesuit *end*
     Now coming back to the Rosicrucians who also used the name Illuminati for their Order
The reason the Rosicrucians look back to the reign of Amenhotep IV was because he was the
last of the Great Pharaohs of Egypt and Hermes Trimegistus the Prophet was born during his
reign *end*  There  is  much  confusion  in  ancient  and  modern  learned  circles  about  who  Hermes
actually was *end* Scholars of mythology said he was just a myth as was Mercury his equivalent
to the Romans *end* His Egyptian equivalent say some scholars was the Egyptian god "Thoth."
The god Thoth or Hermes was the moon god who was the god of time and of its divisions *end* He was the measurer and the god of measurements *end* He was also the conducter of the dead
and god of human Intelligence to whom are attributed all the productions of human Art *end* To
the pagan Egyptians all the literature of Egypt is attributed to Hermes *end* All the writings that
relate to the different sciences mathematics astronomy medicine and music of the Egyptians
were called by the Greeks "The Hermetic Books."
     In Greek mythology Hermes was known as the son of Zeus and Maia *end* He was the god
who invented dice music geometry the interpretation of dreams measures and weights the
arts letters etc *end* He was also regarded as the patron of public treaties as the guardian of roads
and writing *end* Thoth to the Egyptians was considered a great king a teacher of mankind who

the  blasphemous  doctrine

that  man  can  reach  perfection

had left books of magic and mystery behind him *end* Numerous books of such a sort once existed
in Egypt *end* Clement of Alexandria claimed he knew of  so-called Hermetic fragments which
could be found in the works of Stobaeus Cyrillus Suides and Lactantus *end*
     The Hermetic Books fall into two groups *end* The first deals with Astrology Alchemy etc.;
while the others are dialogues describing the soul's regeneration in terms like the Cabala *end* This
is
through  his  own  efforts  by
journeying through the higher spheres of knowledge then after death become God *end* Tradition
says the Egyptian mysteries were a key to a complete knowledge of the Universe and man *end* And this so-called knowledge was preserved in these Hermetic Books which were believed
for centuries to be written by Hermes Trismegistus *end* These books were universally accepted
among  the  doctors  of  occultism  as authentic books of Hermes until  the  early    century
when they were proven to be a fraud *end* They had actually been written as late as the second and
third centuries AD by a succession of anonymous Greeks living in Egypt *end*
       However  even  though  these  Hermetic  Books  were  not  directly  from  Hermes  as  the
occultists  said  there  are  still  some  interesting  facts  to  learn  about  who  Hermes  was  this
legendary god of wisdom *end* To start we need to take a deeper look at the other gods of the
Orient  who  were  the  Eastern  equivalent  to  the  Western  god  Hermes *end*  They  were  known  in
history  as  Nebo  Nabu  and  Eel *end*  Alexander  Hislop  who  spent  years  tracing  down  ancient
gods to Babylonian origin has some very interesting facts compiled from the ancient past in
his book The Two Babylons *end* In this book Hislop states the following
     "If Ninus was Nimrod who was the historical Eel *end* He must have been Cush; for Cush
beget Nimrod Gen *end*  and Cush is generally represented as having been a ringleader in the
great apostacy *end* But again Cush as the son of Ham was Hermes or Mercury; for Hermes is
just an Egyptian synonym for the "son of Ham." Now Hermes was the great original prophet
of idolatry; for he was recognized by the pagans as the author of their religious rites and the
interpreter of the gods."
       The  Two  Babylons  Hislop  pp *end*     *end*  To  the  occultist  tradition  says  the  Egyptian
Mysteries were a key to a complete knowledge of the Universe and of man *end* But the truth is
Egypt received its knowledge of the ancient Mysteries from Babylonia *end* In the traditions of the
ancient writers Ninus is said to be the son of Eel who Gesenius the ancient scribe identifies as
Nebo the Babylonian prophetic god *end* And Hyginus another ancient scribe shows that Nebo
was  Mercury *end*  And  Hyginus  tells  how  a  similar  legend  was  written  about  the  confusion  of
tongues as stated in the Bible *end* Hyginus is quoted by Hislop
   "For many ages men lived under the government of Jove evidently not the Roman Jupiter
but Jehovah of the Hebrews without cities and without laws and all speaking one language *end* But  after  that  Mercury  interpreted  the  speeches  of  men  whence  an  interpreter  is  called
Hermeneutes  the  same  individual  distributed  the  nations  then  discord  began."  The  Two
Babylons Hislop p *end*  *end*
       Now  the  pagans  often  named  places  cities  and  towns  after  their  chief  gods *end*  A  mount
called Nebo east of Jordan over against Jericho in Moab part of the Abarim range with a top
called Pisgah is where our Lord told Moses to view the land which he couldn't enter because
of his transgression Deuteronomy  *end* The word "Nebo" means height  *end*
    The  word  "Baal"  means  Lord  but  the  name  "Eel"  means  "The  Confounder"   *end*  The
ancients often got the two names Baal and Eel mixed up as do modern scholars today *end* The
Scriptures  themselves  show  that  Baal  and  Eel  were  two  distinct  gods  with  TWO  distinct
names *end* In Jeremiah ;  we read "Declare ye among the nations and publish and set
up a standard; publish and conceal not; say Babylon is taken Eel is confounded Merodach is
broken  in  pieces  her  idols  are  confounded  her  images  are  broken  in  pieces."  "And  I  will
punish Eel in Babylon and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed
up and the nations shall not flow together any more unto him yea the wall of Babylon shall
fall."

       Now  Eel  the  Confounder  or  in  other  words  the  god  of  confusion  was  himself  to  be
confounded  by  the  destruction  of  Babylon  the  origin  of  all  pagan  religions *end*  The  name
Babylon itself means "Confusion"  *end* Today the city of Babylon is just as it was predicted
to be and now is a symbol of religious confusion throughout the world which will in these
last closing days unite under one banner *end*
     To the Romans the god Eel who actually was Nimrod's father Cush was worshipped as
Janus the two faced god the god of gods *end* Hislop quotes Ovid another ancient scribe who
wrote of a hymn dedicated to Janus *end*
     "From whom all the other gods had their origin is made to say of himself 'the ancients.. *end* called me Chaos.'" This god Chaos' name is used in our language today to mean confusion *end* The symbol of this god of confusion was a club and Hislop goes on to say the following
     "..that symbol is a club; and the name of a 'club in Chaldee comes from the very word
which signifies 'to break in pieces or scatter abroad.' He who caused the confusion of tongues
was  he  who  'broke'  the  previously  united  earth  Genesis    in  pieces  and  scattered  the
fragments abroad *end* How significant then as a symbol is the club as commemorating the work
of  Cush  as  Eel  the  Confounder *end*  That  significance  will  be  all  the  more  apparent  when  the
reader turns to the Hebrew of Genesis  and finds that the very word from which a club
derives  its  name  is  that  which  is  employed  when  it  is  said  that  in  consequence  of  the
confusion of tongues the children of men were scattered abroad on the face of all the earth *end* The  name  of  Cush  is  also  'Khus'  for  'sh'  frequently  passes  in  Chaldee  into  s;  and  Khus  in
pronunciation  legitimately  becomes  Khawos  or  without  the  digamma  Khaos."  The  Two
Babylons Hislop p *end*  *end*
     In Isaiah  it appears that Nebo and Eel are synonymous *end* "Eel boweth down Nebo
stoopeth." And the symbol of this god the club is called the hammer in Scripture *end* "How is
the  HAMMER  of  the  whole  earth  cut  asunder  and  broken *end*  How  is  Babylon  become  a
desolation  among  the  nations."  Jeremiah   *end*  Hence  it  was  Eel  and  Baal  or  Cush  and
Nimrod  who  caused
the  earth  by
introducing  Astrology  Magic  Necromancy  etc *end*  building  an  antichrist  society  that  would
change "the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man and to
birds  and  fourfooted  beasts  and  creeping
to
uncleanness  through  the  lusts  of  their  own  hearts  to  dishonour  their  own  bodies  between
themselves Who changed the truth of God into a lie and worshipped and served the creature
more than the Creator who is blessed forever *end* Amen." Romans   *end*
     Now look at the name "Hermes" from whom these Secret Societies and occult fraternities
say they draw their philosophies *end* The word Her says Hislop in Chaldee is synonymous with
Ham or Khem  the burnt one *end* This name formed a foundation for covertly identifying
Ham  with  the  Sun  and  so  deifying  the  Patriarch  after  whose  name  the  land  of  Egypt  was
called   *end*  The  Scriptures  themselves  state  that  Egypt  was  founded  by  Ham *end*  "Israel  also
came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the Land of Ham." Psalms   Hislop goes
on to say
     "Her is the name of Horus who is identified with the Sun Bunsen Vol *end* I p *end*  which
shows the real etymology of the name to be from the verb to which I have traced it *end* Then
secondly 'Mes' is from Mesheh for without the last radical which is omissible see Parkhurst
Sub Voce p *end*  Mesh 'to draw forth.' " The Two Babylons Hislop Loizeaux Brothers p *end*  *end*
     What all this means is "Mes" was used by the ancient Egyptians to show the genealogy of
the name applied *end* This will explain the Egyptian names of Kings of Egypt such as Rameses
which  means  "The  Son  of  Ra"  who  was  the  Egyptian  Sun-god  whose  incarnation  was
"Osiris." Hence "Hermes" or "Her-Mes" means "The Son of Her" or Ham who was Cush
 *end* "And the sons of Ham Cush Mizraim and Phut and Canaan." Genesis  *end*
     Now it was really Cush who was worshipped as Hermes Eel Nebo Mercury etc *end* that

modern Secret Societies that even most of their own members are not aware of *end*
     Like the Rosicrucians the Freemasons trace their origins to the Hermetic writings *end* And
ironically enough the Freemasons admit that it was Nimrod along with Hermes Cush who
founded
from  an  authorized  publication  of
Freemasonry called An Encyclopedia of Freemasonry and Its Kindred Sciences by Albert G *end* Mackey " p *end*
    "HERMES"    IN  ALL  THE  OLD  MANUSCRIPTS  &  RECORDS  WHICH  CONTAIN
THE  LEGEND  OF  THE  CRAFT  MENTIONIS  MADE  OF  HERMES  AS  ONE  OF  THE
FOUNDERS OF MASONRY." Mackey goes on to say
    "He  found  one  of  the  two  pillars  of  stone  and  found  the  science  written  therein  and  he
taught  it  to  other  men *end*  There  are  two  persons  of  the  name  of  Hermes  mentioned  in  sacred
history *end* The first is the divine Hermes called by the Romans Mercury *end* Among the Egyptians
he  was  known  as  Thoth *end*  Diodorus  Siculus  describes  him  as  the  secretary  of  Osiris;  he  is
commonly supposed to have been the son of Mizaim and Cumberland says that he was the
same as Osiris *end* There is however much confusion among the mythologists concerning his
attributes *end*
    "The  second  was  Hermes  Trismegistus  or  Thrice  Great  who  was  a  celebrated  Egyptian
legislater priest and philosopher who lived in the reign of Ninus about the year  BC *end* He is said to have written thirty six books on theology and philosophy and six upon medicine
all of which are lost *end* There are many traditions of him; one of which related by Eusebius is
that he introduced hieroglyphics into Egypt *end* This Hermes Trimegistur although the reality of
his existence is doubtful was claimed by the alchemists as the founder of their art whence it
is  called  the  Hermetic  science  AND  WHENCE  WE  GET  IN  MASONRY  HERMETIC
RITES AND HERMETIC DEGREES."
   Now in the same volumes of An Encyclopedia of Freemasonry and its Kindred Sciences by
Albert G *end* Mackey Vol *end*  p *end*  we read who this other founder of Freemasonry was
   "NIMROD." THE LEGEND OF THE CRAFT IN THE OLD CONSTITUTIONS REFER
TO NIMROD AS ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF MASONRY."
     It was indeed NIMROD who was first to teach the arts of masonry *end* Now here lies a key to
understanding  the  mysterious  rituals  of  Freemasonry *end*  Just  as  the  women  who  worshipped
Thammuz were led to weep for the god because in the myth all the images wept for him so
does the Freemason mimic the myths of the Sun-gods during their Hermetic Rituals *end* Just as
the Roman Catholic is taught to mimic the death of Jesus Christ during Holy Week so does
Freemasonry imitate most of the myths of Baal worship *end* Here from their own publications we
will learn the real purposes and goals of the leaders of Freemasonry *end*
   In the Booklet "The Masonic Report" published by C.F *end* McQuaig a former nd Degree
Mason  with  an  Introduction  from  James  D *end*  Shaw  a  former  rd  Degree  Mason  and  past
Master of all Scottish Rite Bodies we have now one of the complete studies into the Secret
behind Freemasonry *end* These former high ranking Freemasons now EXPOSE Freemasonry for
what it actually is in hope that deceived Masons will see who is really the hidden teacher of
their mysteries and choose Jesus Christ as their Lord and Saviour and will openly withdraw
from  it *end*  Space  won't  allow  us  to  examine  the  entire  booklet;  however  we  will  examine
Masonic  books  the  booklet  quotes  and  also  other  Masonic  books  that  we  have  ourselves *end* After the reader has examined these things from their own literature the reader will learn that
Freemasonry is nothing less than WITCHCRAFT *end* All this will be completely exposed in the

great Confederate hero *end* He was honoured also among Masons as "The Prince Adept Mystic
Poet  and  Scholar  of  Freemasonry."  In  the  South  he  was  almost  considered  a  god-man  a

Israel  was  not  a  Mason  nor  did  he  ever  have  any  connection  with  Freemasonry *end*  The  real
reason Freemasonry uses the name Solomon is to hide the real NAMES OF THE SUN-GODS
FROM THREE DIFFERENT NATIONS *end* Again from An Interpretation of Freemasonry by
Martin Wagner p *end*  we read the following
   "This name Solomon is not the Israelitish king *end* IT IS NAME IN FORM BUT DIFFERENT
IN ITS MEANING *end* IT IS A SUBSTITUTE WHICH IS EXTERNALLY LIKE THE ROYAL
NAME *end*  THIS  NAME  IS  A  COMPOSITE *end*  SOL-OM-ON  THE  NAMES  OF  THE  SUN  IN
LATIN  INDIAN  AND  EGYPTIAN  AND  IS  DESIGNED  TO  SHOW  THE  UNITY  OF

   Freemasonry Lodge meetings at this present day are usually held in the upper chambers of
their lodges *end* The worshippers of Baal the Sun-god erected their idols and altars on top of
hills  among  sacred  groves  or  on  the  roofs  of  houses *end*  Now  in  another  authorized  Masonic
publication we read the following
   "Lodge meetings at present day are usually held in upper chambers and the reason for this
custom is that 'Before the erection of temples the celestial bodies were worshipped on hills

    Here  again  from  an  authorized  Masonic  publication   more   shocking   information  about
these Masonic Lodges and the secret meaning of G.A.O.T.U *end* from The Master's Carpet by
Edmond Ronayne past Grand Master of Lodge  in Chicago on pages - we read the
following
   "The Lodge room then is brought before us as a symbol of the Universe GOVERNED BY
THE  SUN-GOD  and  its  cubical  form  expressed  in  the  language  of  the  ritual  is  made  to
represent the united power of light and darkness and the constant conflict which is supposed
to be always going on between them *end* In other words THE LODGE ROOM IS THE REAL
HEAVEN
-
ALWAYS PRESIDES WHERE HIS SYMBOL IS ALWAYS DISPLAYED WHERE HIS
WORSHIP  IS  ALWAYS  PRACTICED  and  when
is  simply
transferred from this lower heaven of this Lodge below to the mount Olympus of the craft
called the Grand Lodge above." Quoted from Masonic Report McQuaig p. *end*
   Now here we see who this god of nature the G.A.O.T.U *end* really is *end* It is the Sun-God *end* And
just as the Witches hold their meetings at night so does the Freemason meet at night *end* Here
from Symbolism of Freemasonry by Albert G *end* Mackey  p *end*
   "Darkness like death is the symbol of initiation *end* It was for this reason that all the ancient
initiations were performed at night *end* The celebration of the mysteries was always nocturnal *end* The  same  custom  prevails  in  Freemasonry  and  the  explanation  is  the  same."   Quoted  from
Masonic Report Mcquaid p. *end*
   In the Hindu religion the Sun-god as in many others was worshipped as we saw earlier as
a Trinity *end* The Trinity was formed because of the three phases of the sun's course *end* At sunrise
the Hindu worshipped his Sun-god as Brahma at noon he was Siva and at sunset he became
Vishnu *end* Now the high priests of Sun worship pretended to be the incarnation of the Sun-gods
and so do the Worshipful Master the Senior Warden and the Junior Warden of these Masonic
Lodges *end* Here from Freemasons Guide by Daniel Sickles on page  we read the following
     "The Worshipful Master represents the sun at its rising the Senior Warden represents the
Sun at its setting and the Junior Warden represents the Sun at Meridian."  Quoted from the
Mosonic Report McQuaig p. *end*
   In Baal worship which is Witchcraft it is taught that the god of nature the Ruler of the
Zodiac the Sun was both male and female *end* Now the three gods of the Trinity or three great
lights  sun  moon  and  stars  were  symbolized  as  the  geometric  symbol  which  the  Greeks

IN  MINIATURE  WHERE  THE  GOD  OF  NATURE  THE  G.A.O.T.U *end*

the  good  Mason  dies  he

called the Delta or the Triangle  *end*
   The Egyptian pyramids to the Sun are solid figures on a triangular square with sloping sides
meeting at an apex *end* The male and female elements of the Sun-god were symbolized as we
saw earlier by two pyramids or triangles The male symbolized as a triangle pointing upward
the female pointing downward *end* As we saw earlier the pagans combined the two to form what
is called the Hexagram *end* This is one of the most evil signs of Witchcraft *end* It is used in magic to
control spirits demons *end* It is used by witches to cast a spell to charm or injure a person or
his property  *end* One of the most common uses for this symbol is the Star of David in the
Jewish faith *end* This six pointed star commonly used by the deceived Jews is called the Seal of
Solomon among Masons  *end* And the five pointed star called the Pentagram that witches get
in  the  center  to  cast  their  spells  is  also  a  Masonic  symbol *end*  They  call  the  Pentagram  the
Blazing Star  *end*
   Now keeping in mind that Freemasonry is astrological in all areas as this will help us see
other deceptions as we go on *end* All Star worship as originally taught by the Babylonians says
man's soul is immortal and at death he had a place in Heaven among the stars *end* However the
chief gods of the Zodiac were the Seven Stars
            *end* Sun   *end* Moon   *end* Venus    *end* Mars    *end* Jupiter   *end* Mercury    *end* Saturn
     The Morning Star which is the East Star the Phoenix or Venus to the Romans was the
nocturnal  representation  of  the  hidden  Sun-god  Osiris  or  his  soul  according  to  Egyptian
mythology *end*  He  was  called  "Athtar"  the  East  Star  among  the  Arabs  which  actually  meant
"Lucifer"  the  Illuminated  One *end*  The  Masons  have  adopted  the  name  "The  Blazing  Star"  to
describe this symbol which the evil sign of Witchcraft the Pentagram derived with its two
horns points attacking Heaven *end*
   Albert Pike says in his book Morals and Dogma on pages  and
   "Our French Brethren place this letter Yod in the centre of the Blazing Star *end* And in the old
Lectures our ancient English Brethren said 'The Blazing Star or glory in the centre refers us
to  that  grand  luminary  THE  SUN  which  enlightens  the  earth  and  by  its  genial  influence
dispenses blessing to mankind." Pike goes on to say
   "They call it also in the same lectures an EMBLEM OF PRUDENCE *end* The word Prudentia
means in its original and fullest signification Foresight; and accordingly the Blazing Star has
been regarded as an EMBLEM OF OMNISCIENCE OR THE ALLSEEING EYE which to
the Egyptian Initiates was the EMBLEM OF OSIRIS THE CREATOR *end* With the Yod in the
centre it has the kabalistic meaning of the Divine Energy manifested as Light creating the
Universe."
   The pyramid with the ALLSEEING EYE as the cap stone which is a symbol of the EYE
OF  LUCIFER  can  be  found  on  the  back  of  an  American  Federal  Reserve  Note  for  One
Dollar *end* We will study how this satanic occult sign became an emblem of the United States
monetary  system  in  the  next  chapter *end*  Very  few  Americans  know  that  more  than    of  the
signatories of the Declaration of independence were either Masons or Rosicrucians and were
much into the esoteric secret sciences such as Astrology Numerology Tarot Cabala etc *end* Our own Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson were both expert astrologers occultists
 *end*
   As we saw earlier the ancients often used animals and birds to represent their chief deities
in their myths *end* The "Phoenix" to the Egyptian was a species of the Heron family with long
crest feathers *end* The name Phoenix to the Egyptians as to other pagan nations was a name that
symbolized  the  Sun-god  under  the  names  Ra  and  Osiris  and  in  later  times  was  also  their
embodiment in the planet Venus which is the Morning Star or East Star *end* The name Phoenix
as  we  pointed  out  earlier  means  "Shining  One"    and  so  does  the  name  "Lucifer"   *end* However  it  was  the  Eagle  Sumerian  symbol  which  took  flight  daily  across  the  vault  of
Heaven and traversed the celestial dominion of the stars and constellations descending toward
the Rising Sun from the storm clouds of Adad *end* The Eagle was a symbol of the Sun-god as the

Spring and Morning Sun victorious over the powers of Darkness and the Underworld through
which he passed nightly  *end*
   As several times throughout this book we have tried to show that it is Satan Lucifer who
is being worshipped through a camouflage of pagan gods symbolized as humans animals or
birds *end* It was Lucifer who was the original "Light Bearer" Isaiah  *end*
    Now  this  sacred  bird  of  light  the  Phoenix  who  was  also  symbolized  as  a  peacock  and
heron is also worshipped today among the American Indians as the Eagle *end* Very few Masons
like the Roman Catholics understand the religion they blindly serve *end* They're told to do things
they  don't  understand  and  they  do  them  without  questioning  why *end*  And  so  is  it  among  the
Protestant circles *end* They never think to check the words their Pastors have told them with the
Holy Scriptures themselves as the Bible clearly states "Prove all things hold fast that which
is good."  .Thessalonians  *end*
   Very few Masons know that Albert Pike this highest authority of Freemasonry The Prince
Adept Mystic Poet and Scholar of Freemasonry was himself also the head of the Palladist
another  Secret  Society  which  openly  worshipped  Lucifer  and  was  bent  on  destroying
Christianity  replacing  it  with  the  worship  of  Lucifer  himself *end*  Albert  Pike  the  head  of  the
Freemasons  was  also  an  Apostle  of  Lucifer *end*  Here  from  the  Encyclopedia  of  Religion  and
Ethics Vol *end*  p *end*  we read the following
   "The latter group with which we are mainly concerned was known under the alternative
names of LUCIFERIANS and PALLADISTS *end* They were said to adore LUCIFER the equal
and  foe  of  ADONAI  Jahweh *end*  He  was  in  their  view  the  God  of  Light  the  good  principle
while  Adonai  was  THE  GOD  OF  DARKNESS  THE  EVIL  PRINCIPLE *end*  In  sort  he  was
Satan himself *end* This worship was founded on a dualistic philosophy and was a sort of topsy-
turvy Christianity *end* The name of Palladists is derived from a palladium which they were said to
revere  namely  the  BAPHOMET  or  grotesque  idol  the  worship  of  which  was  one  of  the
articles of accusations against the "Knights Templars" in the  century *end* It was alleged that
the Baphomet was preserved in secret through nearly five centuries after the suppression of
the order and ultimately carried by one Isaac Long in  together with the skull of the last
Grand Master the unhappy Jacques du Molay from Paris to Charleston in the United States
of America *end* These relies were averred to have there become the sacred objects of a society
which was a development of Freemasonry *end*
   "The head of the society we are told was one ALBERT PIKE under whose influence it
spread all over the civilized world."
   After Albert Pike's death Adriand Lemmi transferred this Luciferian Secret Society from
Charleston to Rome *end* And it was reported that the most foul cruel and obscene rites along
with  the  adjuration  of  Christ  and  his  religion  accompanied  by  the  appearance  of  Satan
himself  were  all  part  of
their  meetings *end*  See
Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics Vol *end*  p *end*  *end*
   From the beginning of this book we have to show the reader that there is a spiritual conflict
between  God  and  Lucifer  and  Christians  and  Luciferans *end*  We  have  tried  to  show  through
into
history  how  Satan  has

the
worship of Adonai Jehovah in Heaven so does Lucifer have him a Worldwide Conspiracy
working today behind the public eye that is bent on destroying the Christian religion and
establishing a Luciferian Government on this earth lust as Christ commissions His people to
go  and  preach  the  Gospel  to  every  kindred  tongue  and  nation  so  does  Lucifer  have  his

   If the reader has any doubts about Albert Pike's involvement in the Luciferian Conspiracy
let his own words in his own book Morals and Dogma help convince you *end* Here from page
  is  how  Pike  slowly  instructs  unsuspecting  Masons  about  the  importance  of  the  Eagle
which is another emblem of Freemasonry and from ancient times a symbol of Lucifer *end*
   "A great Black Eagle King of Birds *end* He alone  it  is  that  can  fire  the  Sun  material  in  its
nature that has no form and yet by its form develops color *end* The black is a complete harbinger
of the work it changes color and assumes a natural form out whereof will emerge a brilliant
Sun." On page  of Morals and Dogma Pike said the following
     "The true name of Satan the Kabalists say is that of Yahveh God reversed; for Satan is
not  a  black  god  but  the  negation  of  God *end*  The  Devil  is  the  personification  of  Atheism  or
Idolatry *end* For the Initiates this is not a PERSON BUT A FORCE CREATED FOR GOOD
BUT  WHICH  MAY  SEAVE  FOR  EVIL  IT  IS  THE  INSTRUMENT  OF  LIBERTY  OR
FREE WILL *end* They represent this Force which presides over the physical generation under
the MYTHOLOGIC and HORNED FORM OF THE GOD PAN; THENCE CAME THE HE-
GOAT  OF  THE  SABBAT  BROTHER  OF  THE  ANCIENT  SERPENT  AND  THE
LIGHTBEARER OR PHOSPHOR OF WHICH THE POETS HAVE MADE THE FALSE
LUCIFER OF THE LEGEND."
   Now on page  of Morals and Dogma Pike says the following
   "Lucifer THE LIGHT-BEARER *end* STRANGE AND MYSTERIOUS NAME TO GIVE TO
THE SPIRIT OF DARKNESS *end* LUCIFER THE SON OF THE MORNING *end* IT IS HE WHO
BEARS  THE  LIGHT  AND  WITH  IT  SPLENDORS  INTOLERABLE  BLINDS  FEEBLE
SENSUAL OR SELFISH SOULS *end* DOUBT IT NOT!"
    Just  as  the  Word  of  God  is  a  Light  that  shines  through  the  darkness  ignorance  of  this
world so is there a counterfeit Light called Illuminism that actually derived from the name
Lucifer *end* For "Lucifer" as we have already seen means "The Illuminated One" or "Shining
One." Speaking about this counterfeit Light Illuminism Gerald B *end* Winrod D.D *end* states  in
his booklet Communism In  Prophecy History America p *end*
   "As divine illumination is experience in the soul of the believer through contact with the
Holy  Spirit  so  also  there  is  a  counterfeit  light  that  poisons  human  thought  and  produces
decay *end* There are 'seducing spirits' that impregnate human minds with 'doctrines of devils.'
   "There is a white light of spiritual illumination *end* But there is also a black light of demonic
illumination *end* Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light... *end* Illuminism is black magic *end* Jannes and Jambres manipulated these powers in the days of Moses *end* The attack is as old as sin
on the planet."
   Luciferians teach it is Christ who is the imposter and the Evil One while it's Lucifer who is
the Good God *end* Like modern Witchcraft Luciferians do not believe that Satan exists *end* They do
not believe Satan and Lucifer are the same god *end*
    Another  Apostle  of  Lucifer  like  Albert  Pike  who  was  equal  in  the  knowledge  of  the
Hermetic Sciences Witchcraft was one Aleister Crowley *end* We will examine more shocking
facts about Albert Pike later on *end* Aleister Crowley - wrote many books on magic *end*
He  was  violently  against  God  and  Christianity  and  saw  himself  as  a  Messiah  of  a  new
religion *end* He was a member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn headed at that time by
a Samuel Liddell Mathers who later expelled Crowley from their Secret Society *end* This Secret
Society  which  exists  today  taught  the  use  of  magical  weapons  and  practiced  ceremonial
magic mixed with drugs and sex *end*
    As  a  child  Crowley  was brought  up  in  a  Christian  environment  where  he  learned  of  the
warning about the Beast of Revelation and its number of doom  *end* However this warning
took just an opposite effect on him *end* Because of his terrible behaviour as a child his mother
said to Crowley that he reminded her of the Beast of the book of Revelation that came out of
the depths of the sea with horns on his head blaspheming God *end* Later as Crowley developed a
deep  seated  hatred  for  Jesus  Christ  he  became  ever  more  zealous  in  trying  to  destroy

IS  "BAPHOMET;"

Christianity *end* To show his rejection of God and the Bible not understanding what the beast
symbolized in the Bible his ignorance led him to proclaim that he was the Beast  and
finally found a name that he could use that would add to that number  *end* The name he used
was "THE WILD BEAST" which in Greek "TO META OHPION" adds to   *end*
   Like Ahab and Jezebel in the Bible he made an all out effort to promote the Mysteries of
Sun  worship *end*  He  held  according  to  Crowley  meetings  with  what  he  called  a  Secret  Chief
familiar  spirit  called  AIWAZ *end*  This  Aiwaz  helped  in  writing  one  of  his  books  called  The
Book  of  the  Law    where Crowley summed up his magical philosophy with his motto
"DO WHAT THOU WILL SHALL BE THE WHOLE LAW"  *end*
   In Crowley's book Magick in Theory and Practice he states the following
   "The Devil is historically the God of any people that one personally dislikes *end* This has led
to so much confusion of thought that The Beast  has preferred to let names stand as they
are and to proclaim simply that Aiwaz -- the solar-phallic hermetic "LUCIFER" is His own
"THE  DEVIL"  SATAN  OR  HADIT  OR  OUR
Holy  GUARDIAN  ANGEL  AND
PARTICULAR UNIT OF THE STARRY UNIVERSE *end* THIS SERPENT SATAN IS NOT
THE  ENEMY  OF  MAN  BUT  WHO  MADE  THE  GODS  OF  OUR  RACE  KNOWING
GOOD  AND  EVIL;  HE  BADE  "KNOW  THYSELF!"  and  taught  Initiation *end*  He  is  "THE
DEVIL"  OF  THE  BOOK  OF  THOTH  AND  HIS  EMBLEM
the
Androgyne who is the hieroglyph of arcane perfection."
Crowley goes on to say
   ".. *end* But moreover his letter is Ayin THE EYE; he is Light and his ZODIACAL IMAGE IS
CAPRICORNUS THAT LEAPING GOAT WHOSE ATTRIBUTE IS LIBERTY."
   Now it was this same Aleister Crowley who helped establish an Order of Rosicrucians in
San Jose California *end* And Crowley is numbered among other magicians and sorcerers such as
Emanuel Swedenborg Sir Richard Kelly Eliphas Levi Alice Bailey and  that  pot-smoking
medium   named  Madame  Blavatsky  founder  of  the  Theosophical  Society  which  we  will
study in a moment as one of the leaders of modern Spiritualism today *end*
   Because the books Aleister Crowley wrote were exposing the secrets of the occult in
Crowley received an unexpected visit at his flat in Victoria Street London from one Theodar
Reuss  a  high  ranking  German  Freemason  and  also  an  agent  of  the  German  Secret  Police *end* Reuss  had  come  over  from  Germany  for
the  express  purpose  of  meeting  Crowley  and
accusing him of giving away magical secrets  *end* Among the occultists giving away secrets
is a crime punishable by death as it is in Freemasonry *end* And since there is very little difference
between any of these Secret Societies this vow of secrecy applies to all occultists *end*
   Now this Theodar Reuss was not only a high ranking German Freemason but belonged to
another Secret Society called ORDO TEMPLI ORIENTIS or Order of the Templars of the
East  that  the  infamous  pot-smoking  Madame  Blavatsky  and  Karl  Relier  an  associate  of
Blavatsky founded in   *end*
   Now special attention should be given to this "Ordo Templi Orientis" for it centers around
much of the Antichrist movement among our young people today *end* The Ordo Templi Orientis
claimed that it could communicate in nine Degrees the secrets not only of Freemasonry but of
the Rosicrucians The Illuminati the Order of the Holy Grail the Knights of the Holy Ghost
and the Holy Sepulchre  *end* Blavatsky and her associates claimed they were the key which
opens  up
sexual  magic
Phallicism  and  this  doctrine  of  sexual  magic  would  explain  without  exception  all  the
secrets of Nature all the symbolism of Freemasonry and all systems of religion  *end*
    So  since  Crowley  was  very  learned  in  these  areas  and  was  revealing  these  things  to  the
ordinary reader in his books Reuss was sent to tell Crowley "Since you know our hidden sex
teachings you'd better come into our Order." Crowley agreed and after a journey to Berlin
he was transformed with due ceremony into the Supreme and Holy King of Ireland Iona and
all  them  Britons  that  are  in  the  Sanctuary  of  the  Gnosis *end*  And  he  gave  himself  the  magical

name of BAPHOMET  which we saw is just another name for Lucifer *end*
   Now this Order of the Templars of the East or Ordo Templi Orientis in the 's had a
Lodge  operating  under  the  name  of  "The  Process  Church  of  the  Final  Judgment"  in  Los
Angeles  *end* This same "Process Church of the Final judgment" attracted a male Witch that
lore
had
scientology  ego  games  subliminal  motivation  music  and  whose  religion  was
the
Yezidis Gnostics and the Palladists of whom Albert Pike was once a leader as we studied
earlier  and  which  was  a  mixture  of  both  Satanism  and  some  elements  of  the  Bible *end*  This
religious  leader  and  revolutionary  claimed  he  was  both  Satan  and  Christ   *end*  His  name  is
Charles  Manson *end*  Ironically  enough  Manson  studied  Witchcraft  while  he  was  in  prison  at
McNeil Island Penitentiary in Washington  *end*
   On March   Manson left prison *end* He was thirty-two years old *end* At first he went to the
Bay area and hung around the Berkeley and the Haight-Ashbury district where he met his
first  disciples  Mary  Brunner  and  Lynn  "Squeaky"  Fromme *end*  He  was  introduced  to  LSD
experienced an hallucination and thought he was Christ *end* When the leader of the "Family" was
arrested he was booked as "Manson Charles M *end* aka Jesus Christ God"  *end*
   Before the slayings that were to become known as the Tate-LaBianca murders Manson and
his Family moved to Santa Barbara and Topanga Canyon where they supported themselves
by theft especially of credit cards and drug dealing."
   Vincent Bugliosi the prosecutor during the Tate-LaBianca trials in his search for a motive
for the barbaric slayings found that the motive was centered around a bizarre religious belief
and rock music *end* Also centered around the infamous Charles Manson Family were found very
well-known names in Hollywood and rock music circles *end*
   In his book Helter Skelter Bugliosi said Manson had an obsession for the Beatles' music
according to former inmates *end* While he was in prison the Beatles song "I Want To Hold Your
Hand"  became  the  No *end*  song  on  the  record  charts  in  lanuary   *end*  Manson's  fanatical
interests while in prison were scientology his guitar and his interest in the Beatles songs *end* But
he  told  numerous  people  that  given  the  chance  he  could  be  much  bigger  than  the  Beatles
 *end*
   Manson believed that the Beatles were modern day prophets that were giving their messages
through their music *end* Manson would quote verbatim lyrics from the Beatles songs finding in
them  a  multitude  of  hidden  meanings *end*  He  would  also  use  his  interpretation  of  Revelation
chapter  to support his own views  *end* Now here lies the bizarre reasoning behind the mass
murders he and his Family committed *end* We are not interested in studying the bloody history of
the actual killings but how these young human beings could be led to do such things *end*
   First of all the reader must remember that the basic foundation to all Witchcraft is the belief
that man will continue to live after death immortality of the soul *end* That man is as it were
stuck in a body but it is only temporary because he has a soul that will live in Paradise at
death *end* This first lie "Ye shall not surely die" as we studied earlier is not a new doctrine but
is as old as this first lie *end* To help a Bible believer understand why the chapter  in the book of
Revelation was more viewed than the     or  chapters by the Manson
Family we have to know the significance behind the occultist doctrine of the number  *end*
   In ancient pagan numerology the number  is the number of the circle which was a symbol
of  infinity  or  immortality *end*  Take  the  zodiac  for  instance *end*  As  we  saw  earlier  it  was  a  °
circle *end* Now the numbers  and  both important to astrologers would add to  if their
components  were  separated  and  added  +=   ++= *end*   Much  medieval  magic  revolves
around the number  *end* It was considered one of  the most potent of numbers because it was
composed of the all powerful  that represented the Trinity   +  +  =  *end*  The number nine
was sacred to the pagan goddess  of death the underworld and Hell the burning place of
torment *end* Witches believed that they could be reincarnated nine times  *end*
   Charles Manson believed and taught that death was only a change *end* "The soul or spirit can't

die" he said *end* Death was "a fear that was born in man's head and can be taken out of man's
head and then it would no longer exist"  *end*
   Ancient pagans believed that death was a blessing for at death they would shed this mortal
body and become a ghost *end* It was recorded that the Aztec Indians in Central Mexico sacrificed
 thousand human beings a year without the slightest guilt of conscience *end* Even the victims
themselves would line up with little resistance to be sacrificed to the Sungod *end* Some believed
it was a high calling to die for the Sun-god because in their myth the Sun and the Stars killed
each  other  at  night *end*  Huitzilopochtli  the  Aztec  Sun-god  was  reborn  every  morning *end*  The
bloody sacrifices of the Aztecs were believed necessary because the Sun-god was nourished
by  human  blood *end*  Most  of  the  wars  carried  out  against  their  neighboring  tribes  were  to  get
unwilling victims to sacrifice *end*
   Charles Manson taught his disciples that they were living in the Age of the Armageddon and
the word he used for this Great Battle was "Helter Skelter." He taught his followers that the
battle of Armageddon would be fought by a race war between the blacks and whites *end* There
are  two  keys  to  understanding  this  ignorant  man's  murderous  propaganda  and  his  false
interpretation of the book of Revelation *end* One the number  in Witchcraft as we have seen
identified with death Hell fire and brimstone and also the immortal soul *end* Hence Manson's
whole  religion  was  based  on  his  interpretation  of  Revelation  chapter   *end*  The  second  key  to
understanding the Manson madness was the revolutionary propaganda from the Beatles songs *end* John Lennon of the Beatles can be quoted as saying "Christianity will go *end* It will vanish and
shrink *end* I needn't argue about that I'm right and I will be proved right *end* We're the Beatles
more popular than Jesus now..." St *end* Louis Globe Democrat Aug *end*   quoted from The
Death of a Nation Stormer Liberty Bell Press  p *end*  *end*
   What came to pass about the Beatles and John Lennon's tragic death is public record but
Christianity  is  still  here  and  will  continue  until  Christ's  Second  Coming *end*  Saith  the  Lord
"These shall make war with the Lamb and the Lamb shall overcome them for he is Lord of
lords  and  King  of  kings  and  they  that  are  with  him  are  called  and  chosen  and  faithful."
Revelation  *end*
   A decade after the Tate-LaBianca murders it was reported that evil propaganda messages
were found in some Beatles songs *end* This article appeared in the San Antonio Light Monday
February   *end* The headline read "Backward masked Satan promos found on some Rock'n
Roll Records." Evil messages were not only found in the Beatles' music but also in other rock
groups such as Led Zeppelin Queen Black Oak Arkansas and the Electric Light Orchestra *end* This  subliminal  technique  of  hiding  satanic  messages  is  known  as  "Backward  Masking."
Messages
the  songs *end*  This
backward masking of messages can only be understood when the record is played backwards *end* This is done by placing the speed of the turntable in neutral position then spinning it by finger
backwards at a speed where the voice of the group is distinguishable *end* The Led Zeppelin song
"Stairway to Heaven" played backwards can be heard to say "MY SWEET SATAN... *end* THE
ONE WILL BE SAD WHO MAKES ME SAD WHOSE POWER IS SATAN." Forward the
lyrics  say  "YES  THERE  ARE  TWO  PATHS  YOU  CAN  GO  BY;  BUT  IN  THE  LONG
RUN THERE'S STILL TIME TO CHANGE THE ROAD YOU'RE ON."
    The  Black  Oak  Arkansas  song  "The  Day  Electricity  Came  to  Arkansas"  contains  the
backward message "SATAN SATAN SATAN HE IS GOD." Although the Beatles songs
do not mention the name Satan in their White Album still it is the Beatles song "Revolution
No *end* " with which Manson was obsessed *end* Charles Manson a satanist himself believed that
the Beatles as modern day prophets were telling Manson through their songs what he was to
do  and  what  was  going  to  cause  the  Battle  of  Armageddon   *end*  Manson's  disciples  also
believed that the Beatles songs were speaking to Charles Manson especially the songs in their
so-called White Album *end* For instance in the song "I Will" can be heard "And when at last I
find you / Your song will fill the air / Sing it loud so I can hear you / Make it easy to be near

that  cannot  be  heard  when  played  forward  are

implanted

in

trying

to  cause

them

to

to  start  a

race  war *end*  We  will  come  back

you."  Manson  interpreted  this  to  mean  the  Beatles  wanted  him  to  make  an  album  too *end*  He
firmly  believed  that  he  was  Christ  and  the  Beatles  were  looking  for  him *end*  Manson  told  his
followers that the Beatles knew that Christ had returned to earth again and that he was living
somewhere in Los Angeles  *end* Here is confusion *end* John Lennon as we saw was antiChrist *end*
   In the Beatles' White Album is a song called "Honey Pie" which can be heard "Oh honey
pie my position is tragic / Come and show me the magic / Of your Hollywood song." The
song goes on to say "Oh Honey Pie you are driving me frantic / Sail across the Atlantic / To
be  where  you  belong."  In  January  and  February  of    just  after  the  White  Album  was
released  Manson  and  his  disciples  tried  to  contact  the  Beatles  through  several  telegrams
letters and through telephone calls to England to invite the Beatles to cross over the Atlantic
and join him in Death Valley *end* However they were without success  *end*
   Manson told his followers that in the Beatles White Album were found the messages that
would  "set  up  things  for  the revolution"  he  believed  was  the  Battle  of  Armageddon *end*  There
were actually five songs that Manson and his disciples took more than the others found on the
album that they believed were messages directed to him *end* They were "Blackbird" "Piggies"
"Revolution " "Revolution " and "Helter Skelter"  *end* In the song "Blackbird singing in
the dead of night / Take these broken wings and learn to fly / AIl your life / You were only
waiting for this moment to arise." Manson interpreted this to mean that the black man was
going  to  arise  overthrow  the  white  man  and  take  his  turn *end*  And  the  Beatles  according  to
Manson  were
this
revolutionary propaganda in a moment *end*
    To  understand  this  satanic  delusion  we  need  to  see  how  Manson  butchered  the  Holy
Scriptures  to  support  his  prophecy  of  Helter  Skelter  Armageddon *end*  In  Revelation    we
read
  "And the fifth angel sounded and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth and to him was
given the key of the bottomless pit." Now Manson's interpretation of the bottomless pit is a
cave  underneath  Death  Valley  where  his  chosen  people  the  Family  would  go  during  the
Negro Revolt Helter Skelter that he said the Hopi Indians knew about  *end* Manson said his
Family  were  the  original  Christians  reincarnated  and  that  the  Romans  had  returned  as  the
Establishment *end*  Hence  Manson  and  his  chosen  people  would  remain  in  this  secret  paradise
underneath Death Valley until his chosen people grew to the number  *end* Manson told
his disciples that the bottomless pit has a golden city with a river of milk and honey that runs
through it and a tree that bears twelve kinds of fruit a different fruit each month *end* You don't
need  to  bring  candles  nor  any  flashlights  down  there  because  the  walls  will  glow  and  it
wouldn't be cold or be too hot *end* And there would be warm springs and fresh water and people
would already be down there waiting for him  *end*
    The  first  four  angels  of  Revelation  chapters    and    Manson  interpreted  to  be  the  four
Beatles and the Locusts insects were describing the Beatles also because "They had hair as
the hair of women" Revelation  *end* Out of the mouths of the Four Angels Beatles "issued
fire  and  brimstone."  In  Revelation
the  fire  and  brimstone  CAME  OUT  OF  THE
MOUTHS OF THE HORSES NOT THE FOUR ANGELS as Manson mis-interpreted *end* This
fire and brimstone represented the lyrics according to Manson the power of the songs of the
Beatles   *end*  Their  "breastplates  of  fire"  were  the  electric  guitars *end*  Their  shapes  "like  unto
horses  prepared  unto  battle"  were  their  dune  buggies *end*  The  Horsemen  who  numbered  two
hundred  thousand  thousand  and  who  would  roam  the  earth  spreading  destruction  were  the
motorcycle gangs *end* And the Fifth Angel according to Manson was himself  *end*
   Now in Revelation  it talks about "the SEAL OF GOD in their foreheads." Manson was
asked what this meant and he said that this meant there would be a MARK on people that only
he  would  be  able  to  see  and  the  MARK  would  designate  whether  they  were  with  him  or
against him  *end*
   And in Revelation  we read "And they had a king over them which is the angel of the

bottomless pit whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon but in the Greek tongue hath
his  name  APOLLYON *end*  "  Abaddon  means  "destroyer."  Manson  who  believed  he  was  both
Christ and Satan incarnated believed that this applied to him for according to Manson he
was "the king which is the angel of the bottomless pit."
    The  Beatles  song  "Revolution  "  contains  a  segment  that  played  backward  has  another
message *end* The repetition of "number nine number nine" in reverse says "Turn me on dead
man." "Revolution " as given on the jacket insert reads "You say you want a revolution /
Well you know / We all want to change the world.. *end*  / But when you talk about destruction /
Don't you know that you can count me out." However when you listen to the record itself
immediately after "OUT" you hear the word "IN" and Manson took this to mean the Beatles
once undecided now favored the Revolution *end* Now later on in the song the lyrics say "You
say you got a real solution / Well you know / We'd all love to see the plan." To Manson the
meaning of this lyric was obvious Manson was to sing out and tell the TUNE-IN people how
to escape the Armageddon Helter Skelter  *end*
   In "Revolution " the listener hears whispers shouts snatches of dialogue from the BBC
bits of classical music mortars exploding babies crying church hymns car horns and football
yells-which together with a chant of "Number  Number  Number " build to a climax of
machinegun fire and screams followed by the soft and obviously symbolic lullaby of "Good
Night"  *end*
    Manson  said  this  was  the  Beatles'  way  of  prophesying  the  battle  of  Armageddon  which
Manson believes is a race war *end* In the background of all this noise on Revolution  Manson
heard the oinking of pigs and a man's voice saying "Rise."  This to Manson was the Beatles'
way  of  telling  the  black  man  that  now  was  the  time  to  RISE  and  start  the  Armageddon *end*
Manson  told  his  followers  that  the  race  war would  start  by  Blacks  going  to  the  rich  piggy
districts  and  murdering  them  cutting  bodies  up  smearing  blood  and  writing  things  on  the
wall in blood *end* These superatrocious crimes would cause the white man to start the war *end* The
statement Manson made signed his own guilt decree *end* On the walls of the places where the
murder victims were found written in blood were the words DEATH TO THE PIGS RISE
and HELTER SKELTER  *end*
   The whole plan of this revolution and terrorism was to incite the white man into starting
another civil war *end* The question is was all this an isolated plan of one crazed lunatic or was
Manson himself just a pawn in a much larger circle of hidden instigators that want to provoke
revolution riots race wars and anarchy *end*
   John A *end* Stormer author of the seven-million-copy best seller None Dare Call It Treason
has written another book called The Death of a Nation where he has documentive proof that
the riots of the late 's were Communist inspired
    "The  Riots  Looting  sniper  attacks  on  police  and  massive  civil  disturbances  which  have
racked  American  cities  since    are  part  of
the  Communist  program  for  destroying
America's ability to resist *end*
    "In  February    FBI  Chief  J *end*  Edgar  Hoover  told  a  committee  of  the  U.S *end*  Congress
'Communists and other subversives and extremists strive and labor ceaselessly to precipitate
racial trouble and take advantage of racial discord in this country *end* Such elements were active
in  exploiting  and  aggravating  the  riots  for  example  the  Harlem  Watts  Cleveland  and
Chicago.' "  Quoted from The Death of a Nation Stormer Liberty Bell Press  p *end*  *end*
   Now another question should be asked *end* Who are the Communists *end* Where did they actually
come from *end* Did they just appear out of thin air *end* Or are they too just another pawn for a much
larger  circle  of  hidden  instigators  that  want  to  provoke  revolution  riots  race  wars  and
anarchy *end* As we continue to study the Great Luciferian Conspiracy the reader will learn that
Luciferian  fronts  designed  to  destroy  all  controlling  governments  and  religions  are  the  real
hidden  instigators  of  all  the  Communist  Parties  of  the  world  and  Communism  actually
derived  out  of  Spiritualism Witchcraft *end* And the diabolical  scheme  of  the  Manson  Family

is  dedicated

to  fighting

legal  battles  on  behalf  of  pagans  and

and the riots of the sixties are only a shadow of what Lucifer's plans are for the future *end* The
whole  world  is  to  be  thrown  into  riot  and  Revolution  by  these  conspirators  as  a  way  to
frighten the inhabitants into a one world government *end* Just to show what people can be led to
do by a false religious spirit Susan Atkins one of the murderers of Sharon Tate and a member
of the Manson Family Conspiracy with her puppy-dog eyes and childish manner told a jail
inmate that she helped kill Sharon Tate and said "YOU HAVE TO HAVE A REAL LOVE
IN YOUR HEART TO DO THIS FOR PEOPLE"  *end*
   What could lead these people we just read about to train their consciences to accept these
murders and social upheavals they tried to cause *end* The real source and blame can be placed on
those  whom  Satan  used  during  the      and    centuries who were responsible for
reviving the sciences of Witchcraft *end* Manson and the Communist Party are products of the
writings  of  Emanuel  Swedenburg  Adam  Weishaupt  Sir  Richard  Kelly  Eliphas  Levi  Karl
Marx  Madame  Blavatsky  Aleister  Crowley  Margaret  Murry  Gerald  B *end*  Gardner  just  to
name a few *end* We will examine this more as we continue *end*
   To show the reader how Witchcraft is gaining control on October   Leo Martello
long an activist for civil and gay rights organized a "Witch-In" in New York's Central Park *end*
He finally obtained a permit from the Parks Department to stage his demonstration with the
determined efforts of the New York Civil Liberties Union *end* Martello shortly after formed what
was to become the Witches Anti-Defamation League devoted to securing religious rights for
Witches   *end*  Then  later  Isaac  Bonewits  a  self-proclaimed  male  Witch  and  a  number  of
other  occultists  formed  the  AADL  the  Aquarian  Anti-Defamation  League  we  often  hear
about *end*  This  organization
occultists  *end*
   As stated earlier Witchcraft is the biggest rival of modern Christianity *end* The average gullible
Christian has no knowledge of what is happening all around him even within his own church
about how Spiritualism is a very serious threat *end* However we are determined to bring these
things  out  in  the  light  for  all  to  see *end*  But  to  do  this  the  reader  must  have  a  complete
understanding of what these Secret Societies actually are *end*
   Like Witchcraft Freemasons are bound by oaths and obligations under the pain of death if
they should prove willfully guilty of violating any part of their solemn oaths or obligations *end* One of their obligations is toward their brother Mason *end* In the Masonic Hand Book on page
 we read
   "Whenever you see any of our signs made by a brother Mason and especially the grand
hailing sign of distress you must always be sure to obey them even at the risk of your life *end* If
you're on a jury and the defendant is a Mason and makes the Grand Hailing sign you must
obey it; you must DISAGREE WITH YOUR BROTHER JURORS IF NECESSARY; BUT
YOU  MUST  BE  SURE  NOT  TO  BRING  THE  MASON  GUILTY  FOR  THAT  WOULD
BRING DISGRACE UPON THE ORDER *end* IT MAY BE PERJURY TO BE SURE TO DO
THIS BUT THEN YOU'RE FULFILLING YOUR OBLIGATION AND YOU KNOW IF
YOU LIVE UP TO YOUR OBLIGATIONS YOU'LL BE FREE FROM SIN." Quoted in The
Masonic Report McQuaig p *end*  *end*
   During the Tate-LaBianCa trials - with Susan Atkins testifying to how good it felt when the
knife went into Sharon Tate -- Manson was flashing Masonic hand signals to the judge  *end*
We  made  a  statement  a  little  while  back  that  Freemasonry  is  nothing  less  than  BAAL
WORSHIP *end* So that there will be no more confusion about this we will now let the Masons
say so themselves *end* Here from The Master's Carpet by Edmond Ronayne on page  we read
the following
    "So  then  Because  OUR  ANCIENT  BRETHREN  --  'THE  OLD  SUN-WORSHIPERS'  --
MET  ON  THE  HIGHEST  HILLS  TO  WORSHIP  BAAL  OR  THE  SUN-GOD  AND
FREEMASONRY BEING THAT SAME WORSHIP REVIVED IT MUST NECESSARILY
FOLLOW THAT MASONIC LODGES MUST BE HELD IN THE HIGHEST ROOMS OF

BUILDINGS TO CARRY OUT THE COINCIDENCE." Quoted from The Mosonic Report
McQuaig p *end*  *end*
    Many  of  the  lower  Degrees  of  Freemasonry  in  America  and  England  will  urge  that  the
things we have exposed about Freemasonry thus far are false because they have been led to
believe that Freemasonry is a Christian organization *end* But the higher Degrees of Freemasonry
should know that nothing could be further from the truth *end* Now it is true that in Christian lands
the Bible is placed with a Square and a Compass on the altar of their Lodges *end* However like
the name Solomon the Bible is just a symbol in Freemasonry not a standard of measuring
truth *end* Here again from Albert Pike's Morals and Dogma page  we read the following
   "The Holy Bible Square and Compasses are not only styled the Great Lights in Masonry
but they are technically called the Furniture of the Lodge; and as you have seen it is held that
there is no Lodge without them *end* This has sometimes been made a pretext for excluding Jews
from our Lodges Because they cannot regard the New Testament as a Holy Book *end* The Bible
is an INDISPENSABLE PART OF THE FURNITURE OF A CHRISTIAN LODGE ONLY
BECAUSE  IT  IS  THE  SACRED  BOOK  OF  THE  CHRISTIAN  RELIGION *end*  The  Hebrew
Pentateuch in a Hebrew Lodge and the Koran in a Mohammedan one belong on the Altar;
and  one  of  these  and  the  Square  and  Compass  properly  understood  are  the  LIGHTS  BY
WHICH A MASON MUST WALK AND WORK."
   Reader the truth is Freemasonry has nothing whatsoever to do with the Bible *end* It is just used
as an ornament to attract Christian men into the lodge in Christian lands *end* In a book Digest of
Masonic Law on pages  through  we find a statement that says this
  "MASONRY HAS NOTHING WHATSOEVER TO DO WITH THE BIBLE THAT IT IS
NOT FOUNDED ON THE BIBLE FOR IF IT WERE IT WOULD NOT BE MASONRY IT
WOULD BE SOMETHING ELSE." Quoted from The Masonic Report McQuaig p *end*  *end*
   Now that the Masonic Books have established that Masonry is the pagan religions of the
world  under  one  banner  what  about  the  God  of  the  Bible  the  Lord  Jesus  Christ *end*  Is  he
worshipped in any of these Masonic Lodges *end* From The Masonic Hand Book page  we
read
   "Whether you swear or take God's name in vain don't MATTER SO MUCH *end* OF COURSE
THE NAME LORD JESUS CHRIST AS YOU KNOW DON'T AMOUNT TO ANYTHING
BUT  MAH-HAH-BONE  --  O  HORROR *end*  YOU  MUST  NEVER  ON  ANY  ACCOUNT
SPEAK  THAT  AWFUL  NAME  ALOUD *end*  THAT  WOULD  BE  A  MOST  HEINOUS
CRIME.. *end*  UNMASONIC
from  The  Masonic  Report
McQuaig p *end*  *end*
   Now here we start to see the real colors of Freemasonry *end* Again from the Masonic Hand
Book page  we read the following

any  of  OUR  GREAT  SECRETS;  WHENEVER  FOR
INSTANCE HE TELLS ANYTHING ABOUT BOAZ OR TUBALCAIN OR JACHIN OR
THAT  AWFUL  MAH-HAH-BONE  OR  EVEN  WHENEVER  A  MINISTER  PRAYS  IN
THE NAME OF CHRIST IN ANY OF OUR ASSEMBLIES YOU MUST ALWAYS HOLD
YOURSELF IN READINESS IF CALLED UPON TO CUT HIS THROAT FROM EAR TO
EAR  PULL  OUT  HIS  TONGUE  BY  THE  ROOTS  AND  BURY  HIS  BODY  AT  THE
BOTTOM OF SOME LAKE OR POND." Quoted from The Masonic Report McQuaig p *end*  *end*     Does  the  reader  need  to  go  on  and  on  through  the  doctrines  of  Freemasonry  to  see  for
himself that Freemasonry is anti-Christ and it speaks as a dragon *end* However we want to make
clear to the reader that most Masons do not know these things that have been shown to you
until they reach the highest degrees of Freemasonry *end* The pattern of deception in Freemasonry
is  the  very  same  pattern  of  deceptions  found  in  Witchcraft *end*  There  are  lower  and  higher
Degrees  of  knowledge  in  Witchcraft  too *end*  The  lower  class  worship  at  first  a  system  of  a
godhead with a mother goddess and a pagan saviour of the world *end* In Egypt the godhead of
Sun worship was Osiris the Sun Isis the  Moon  and  Horus  the  Star *end* In Babylon they

--  UNPARDONABLE."   Quoted

"When

a  Brother

reveals

were Baal Ishtar and Tammuz *end* In Mexico they were Teotl Coatlicue and Quetzalcoatl *end* All
these gods derived from the first King in the world the first builder of cities mason and his
wife known in history as Semiramis *end* Nimrod and his wife Semiramis are where all the Sun-
gods and Moon goddesses can be traced and so is it with the religion of Freemasonry *end*
    We  have  already  seen  that  even  Freemasons  admit  that  the  founders  of  their  Order  were
Nimrod  and  Hermes  Cush *end*  But  even  some  chief  adepts  of  these  systems  of  idolatry  are
ignorant of this fact *end* However when the initiate finally reaches the highest level of pagandom
and of Masonry he discovers from the learned Doctors that these gods that he was taught to
worship  do  not  exist *end*  Initiates  are  taught  to  worship  these  gods  at  first  because  within  the
worship of these gods are knowledge of secret sciences of the Universe and the worship of
these  gods  will  teach  to  the  student  of  Freemasonry  the  discipline  of  a  close  knit  civilized
society which is beneficial to mankind *end*
   Masons are purposely deceived at first then as they progress through the higher Degrees of
Masonry which is nothing less than learning more about the satanic power of Witchcraft
they are gradually conditioned to accept the Luciferian doctrine that it is Lucifer who is really
the god behind all gods *end* To see this is true we will go back and quote again a statement by
Albert Pike *end*
   Pike writing about the pagan Trinity of the Angle-Saxons states the following
   "Our northern ancestors worshipped this Triune Deity; Odin the Almighty Father; Frea his
wife emblem of the universal matter; and Thor his son the Mediator *end* But ABOVE THESE
WAS THE SUPREME GOD'THE AUTHOR OF EVERYTHING THAT EXISTETH THE
ETERNAL THE ANCIENT THE LIVING and AWFUL BEING THE SEARCHER INTO
CONCEALED THINGS THE BEING THAT NEVER CHANGETH.' "  Morals and Dogma
Pike p *end*  *end*
   Above all the gods Pike says there is another *end* Now since we have already seen statements
found in authorized books on Freemasonry that this other god is not Jesus Christ it should not
be hard for the reader to believe the shocking truth we are now about to show *end* Pike knows that
these cosmic gods of astrology do not exist and he plainly states how ignorant they are that
worship them *end* From Morals and Dogma Pike page  we read the following
   "In all the histories of the gods and heroes lay couched and hidden astronomical details and
the history of the perations of visible nature; and those in turn were also symbols of higher
and  profounder
the  RUDE  UNCULTIVATED  INTELLECTS  COULD
LONG  CONSIDER  THE  SUN  AND  STARS  AND  THE  POWERS  OF  NATURE  AS
DIVINE OR AS FIT OBJECTS OF HUMAN WORSHIP AND THEY WILL CONSIDER
THEM  SO  WHILE  THE  WORLD  LASTS  AND  EVER  REMAIN  IGNORANT  OF  THE
GREAT SPIRITUAL TRUTHS OF WHICH ARE THE HIEROGLYPHICS."
   To show that most Masons do not know the true purpose of Freemasonry and its god here
again from The Masonic Report on page  McQuaig says
    "That
PRESERVED  IN  MASONRY  but  not  the  pseudo-Masonry  of  the  majority  of  the  craft
members."
   From a Masonic book called Black and White Hartmen p *end*  we read  "FORTUNATE IS
THE MASON OR PRIEST WHO UNDERSTANDS WHAT HE TEACHES *end* BUT OF SUCH
DISCIPLES THERE ARE ONLY A FEW" Quoted from The Mosonic Report p *end*  *end*
    Now
to  deceive
Masonry's  ignorant  masses  into  believing  that  they  know  something  about  the  secrets  of
Masonry  when  in  reality  they  know  nothing  whatsoever *end*  Albert  Pike  expresses  this  in  his
book Morals and Dogma on page
    "The  Blue  Degrees  are  but  the  outer  or  portico  of  the  Temple *end*  Part  of  the  symbols  are
displayed
the  Initiate  BUT  HE  IS  INTENTIONALLY   MISLED  BY  FALSE
INTERPRETATIONS *end* IT IS NOT INTENDED THAT HE SHALL UNDERSTAND THEM;

HIDDEN SO CAREFULLY CENTURIES SINCE IN THE HIGH DEGREES AS THAT IT
IS  EVEN  YET  POSSIBLE  TO  SOLVE  MANY  OF  THE  ENIGMAS  WHICH  THEY
CONTAIN *end* IT IS WELL ENOUGH FOR THE MASS OF THOSE CALLED MASONS TO
IMAGINE  THAT  ALL
IN  THE  BLUE  DEGREES;  AND  WHOSO
ATTEMPTS  TO  UNDECEIVE  THEM  WILL  LABOR  IN  VAIN  AND  WITHOUT  ANY
TRUE  REWARD  VIOLATE  HIS  OBLIGATIONS  AS  AN  ADEPT  MASONRY  IS  THE
VERITABLE SPHINX BURIED TO THE HEAD IN THE SANDS HEAPED ROUND IT
BY THE AGES."
   From the very first deception in the Garden of Eden unto this present day Satan has caused
man to err from the True God by keeping him busy in seeking things that lead away from
God *end* By kindling a desire in Adam and Eve to go outside the law of God Satan caused Adam
and Eve to lose eternal life *end* It was self indulgence and self glorification that led Eve to seek
this mysterious knowledge of good and evil *end* Satan told Eve by taking the fruit of the tree of
knowledge her eyes would be open and she would become as gods *end* In other words she would
reach the great heights of wisdom *end* Her curiosity was aroused and Satan kindled a desire in her
to want to know about this forbidden knowledge *end* This same voice  has been preserved  and
heard  through the mouths of the Adepts of Freemasonry and all other Secret Societies and
religions that teach Babylonian precepts *end* This same trap that made Eve fall into a snare of the
Devil is used the same way today *end* This same forbidden knowledge Satan used on Eve is today
called the Mysteries to the occultists *end* In the Bible it's called "MYSTERY BABYLON THE
GREAT  THE  MOTHER  OF  HARLOTS  AND  ABOMINATIONS  OF  THE  EARTH."
Revelation  *end*
    Very  few  Americans  know  what  part  Secret  Societies  have  played  and  are  playing  in
Lucifer's  attempt  to  establish  his  total  rule  on  this  planet *end*  This  is  and  has  been  a  gradual
attempt to overthrow Christianity and Jesus Christ *end* As we stated before what Lucifer tried to
do in Heaven this world now is experiencing *end* Instead of a struggle only between Lucifer and
his angels and Christ and His Angels the conflict is now between Christ and His people who
have His Spirit and Lucifer and his people who are possessed by him and his devils *end* Satan is
pouring  out  his  power  to  his  human  agents  to  work  miracles  and  lying  wonders  without
measure to deceive and destroy the very elect of God if possible *end*
   "Woe to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea *end* for the Devil is come down unto you
having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time." Revelation  *end*
   Satan has been hiding behind these Secret Societies to further his plans in his conspiracy to
condition  the inhabitants of  this world to accept his rule *end* But  this is only one of his fronts *end* We  will  lay  wide  open  as  we  did  Freemasonry  an  even  more  diabolical  scheme  to  cause
inhabitants  of  this  world  to  lose  their  part  in  what  Christ  promised  in  Scripture *end*  As  we
continue to follow history we will see how Lucifer will deceive the very elect if possible *end*
    Very  few  loyal  Americans  know  what  part  Freemasonry  has  played  in  helping  Lucifer
establish his total power and rule in this world *end* American Freemasonry has become a mass
movement *end*  In  many  small  towns  of  the  South  and  middle  West  almost  every  white  male
Protestant  gentleman  belongs  to  a  Masonic  Lodge   *end*  And  sharp  distinctions  are  drawn
between
"Protanes"  *end* With millions of members tens of millions of dollars of assets and property
and billions of dollars worth of insurance in force this should give the reader understanding
about how much power is behind this Secret Society *end* The Rosicrucians alone spend
a  year  seeking  recruits  through  newspapers  and  magazines *end*  The  advertisement  promises  to
open  the  door  of  success  prosperity  and  popularity *end*  All  the  mysteries  of  life  and  death
reincarnation extrasensory perception and the secrets of the ancient mystical schools will be

San Jose California *end* After the reader sends in the coupon and asks for further information
about the Rosicrucian organization he is sent a booklet entitled "Mystery of Life" which lists
very  familiar  names
identified  as  Rosicrucians  such  as  Benjamin
Franklin Isaac Newton and Rene Descartes."
   Now the reader has seen from authorized publications of these Secret Societies that they do
not exalt or worship the Christian God of the Bible but exalt the pagan gods of astrology and
teach the mysteries of the occult which is Witchcraft *end* It should not be too hard now for the
reader to understand why we have today these signs of Witchcraft mingled within our own
United States governmental symbols *end* Now that the reader is aware of the paganism in these
Secret  Societies  and  how
they  are
Christian organizations it should not be hard to realize how the inventor of the occult the god
of  these  Secret  Societies  used  deceived  Masons  and  Rosicrucians  to  help  establish  this
country *end* Benjamin Franklin himself an expert in occultism joined one of the first American
Lodges  of  Masonry  and  published  an  edition  of  Anderson's  Constitution  in   *end*  George
Washington joined the Fredricksburg Lodge of Masonry in Virginia in  *end* Patrick Henry
Paul Revere and John Paul Jones wore the apron of Masonry and so did Benedict Amold
 *end* A plaque on the wall that surrounds the Alamo in San Antonio Texas lists the names of
those  who  died  in  the  Texas  Revolution  in  February  and  March  of   *end*  The  plaque  was
dedicated by the Freemasonry Order in honour of Masons who gave their lives there *end* Among
the names are Col *end* William Travis James Bowie and David Crockett *end*
    Since
the  start  Masonic  Presidents  Governors  Senators  and
Congressmen making our laws and governing the affairs of our Nation it should not be too
hard for the reader to understand how a pagan goddess that Witchcraft exalts that the Roman
Catholic Church worships as the Virgin Mary is standing on top of the Capitol of the United
States of America *end*
    It  was  not  by  chance  that  the  Capitol  Building  itself  was  designed  after  the  rotunda  or
dome of St *end* Peter's Basilica in Vatican City *end* James Hoban believe it or not was a Catholic
Freemason who designed the Capitol of the United States and was the chief founder of the
Federal Masonic Number  in the District of Columbia  *end*
   Now here are some more astonishing facts *end* Has the reader ever wondered how the strange
structure  called
the
Egyptian  god  Osiris  which  derived  out  of  the  legends  of  Nimrod  Osiris  was  said  to  have
been killed by a rival god and cut into  different pieces *end* After cutting the body of Osiris into
 pieces this rival god threw all of the parts of Osiris along the Nile *end* Isis his wife found all
the  pieces  but  one  his  genital  member *end*  Now  remember  Osiris  was  worshipped  as  the
Creator  the Impregnating Force of the Universe so the mother goddess Isis moulded with
her hands an image of the dead god's phallus and set up one to be venerated as a monument to
Osiris  *end* Hence the origin of Phallicism *end* So in the Temple services of the pagans a coffin
with an image of Osiris' phallus in it became part of the worship of the Sun-god *end* This same
phallic  image  has  been  passed  down  through  history  to  us  today *end*  Its  name  is  the  obelisk
which even a small child should have seen many times *end* Gross darkness are the deceptions of
Satan *end*  The  obelisk  the  sacred  phallic  symbol  of  Osiris  Nimrod  is  now  standing  in  St *end* Peter's Square at the Vatican with a cross erected on top of its pyramid *end* And it's also standing
 feet high in Washington DC *end* And this is the origin of the church steeple *end*
   It was not by chance that the Pentagram  pointed star was chosen to represent states in the
American  Flag *end*  It  was  not  by  chance  that  the  Pentagon  is  shaped  after  the  center  of  the
Pentagram that Witches and Warlocks get in the center of to cast their spells *end* It was not by
chance that crimson white and blue three of the four colors of Witchcraft were chosen to
become  the  colors  of  the  flag *end*  It  was  not  by  chance  that  the  Eagle  the  ancient  symbol  of
Lucifer was chosen to become a symbol of the United States *end*

evident  that  most  of  these  loyal  Americans  were  not  aware  of  the  real  satanic  character  of
their fraternities *end* What our founding fathers designed to protect American citizens from both
governmental and religious tyranny was and is still today a shield against any religion using
legislation to force its beliefs on others as did the papacy during the Middle Ages *end*
   America during the brutal Inquisitions was still a wilderness and became a haven for Bible-
believing  Christians *end*  This  wilderness  land  that  was  later  to  be  called  the  United  States  hid

a  symbol  of  Satan  and  Satan's  religion *end*  The  Roman  Catholic  Church  was  a  false  religious

   Of all the books of the Bible the book of Revelation is the one in which our Lord Jesus
promises a blessing upon those who take the time to read it understand it and obey the truths
found in it *end* This book is a Testimony from Christ Himself not from the Apostle John *end* The
Apostle John was only the faithful penman who wrote down these things for Jesus to give us
hope  instruction  in  righteousness  and  to  unmask  Satan's  deceiving  schemes  in  the  human
affairs of this world *end* All through the Bible you will read in the beginning of the first chapter
of each book the name of the faithful writer who wrote the book under the inspiration of the
Holy Spirit such as the book of Isaiah or Jeremiah or the Gospels *end* However Jesus speaking
about
the
prophecies  of  this  ancient  book  written  about    AD  have  already  come  to  pass *end*  In  this
volume  we  will  only  study  the  prophecies  that  concern  us  today *end*  We  will  learn  about  the

the  book  of  Revelation  says  "The  Revelation  of  JESUS  CHRIST"  Most  of

three great powers that Lucifer will use to cause the whole world to unite in our day under
one banner *end* These three great powers we will learn about from the prophecies are the Roman
Catholic Church The Illuminati and American Protestantism *end* It will be these three powers
that will bring Lucifer's great Conspiracy to its final stage *end*
   To begin this study we must turn to Revelation Chapter  and study it in detail *end* Here is
the Prophecy
   "And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials and talked with me
saying  unto  me  Come  hither;  I  will  shew  unto  thee  the  iudgment  of  the  great  whore  that
sitteth upon many waters With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication and
the inhabitants of the earth have  been  mode  drunk  with  the  wine of her fornication *end* So he
carried  me  away  in  the  spirit  into  the  wilderness;  and  I  saw  a  woman  sit  upon  a  scarlet
coloured  beast  full  of  names  of  blasphemy  having  seven  heads  and  ten  horns *end*  And  the
woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour and decked with gold and precious stones
and  pearls  having  a  golden  cup  in  her  hand  full  of  abominations  and  filthiness  of  her
fornication  And  upon  her  forehead  was  a  name  written  MYSTERY  BABYLON  THE
GREAT THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH *end* AND I
SAW THE WOMAN DRUNKEN WITH THE BLOOD OF THE SAINTS AND WITH THE
BLOOD  OF  THE  MARTYRS  OF  JESUS  and  when  I  saw  her  I  wondered  with  great
admiration *end*  And  the  angel  said  unto  me  Wherefore  didst  thou  marvel *end*  I  will  tell  thee  the
mystery of the woman AND OF THE BEAST THAT CARRIED HER WHICH HATH THE
SEVEN HEADS AND TEN HORNS *end* The beast that thou sawest was and is not and shall
ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into perdition and they that dwell on the earth shall
wonder whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world
when they behold the beast that was and is not and yet is *end* And here is a mind which hath
wisdom *end* The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sitteth *end* And there are
seven kings five are fallen and one is and the other is not yet come; and when he cometh he
must continue a short space *end* And the beast that was and is not even he is the eighth and is of
the seven and goeth into perdition *end* And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings which
have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beest *end* These
have one mind and shall give their power unto the beast *end* These SHALL MAKE WAR WITH
THE  LAMB  AND  THE  LAMB  SHALL  OVERCOME  THEM  FOR  HE  IS  LORD  OF
LORDS  AND  KING  OF  KINGS  AND  THEY  THAT  ARE  WITH  HIM  ARE  CALLED
AND CHOSEN AND FAITHFUL *end* AND HE SAITH UNTO ME THE WATERS WHICH
THOU
AND
MULTITUDES  AND  TONGUES *end*  AND  THE  TEN  HORNS  WHICH  THOU  SAWEST
UPON  THE  BEAST  THESE  SHALL  HATE  THE  WHORE  AND  SHALL  MAKE  HER
DESOLATE  AND  NAKED  AND  SHALL  EAT  HER  FLESH  AND  BURN  HER  WITH
FIRE *end* FOR GOD HATH PUT IT IN THEIR HEARTS TO FULFIL HIS WILL AND TO
AGREE AND GIVE THEIR KINGDOM UNTO THE BEAST UNTIL THE WORDS OF
GOD SHALL BE FULFILLED *end* AND THE WOMAN WHICH THOU SAWEST IS THAT
GREAT CITY WHICH REIGNETH OVER THE KINGS OF THE EARTH."
    Now  let's  back  up  and  read  a  few  verses  at  a  time  and  search  the  Scriptures  for  the
interpretation *end*  Verses  -  picture  a  lewd  woman  with  whom  the  kings  of  the  earth  have
committed fornication and she also has made the other inhabitants of the earth drunk with the
wine of her fornication *end* This woman was seen in vision as sitting on a scarlet beast full of
names of blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns *end* The lewd woman was also arrayed in
purple and scarlet colour decked with gold and precious stones pearls having a golden cup
in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication *end* And on her forehead was a
name written - MYSTERY BABYLON THE GREAT THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND
ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH *end*
    The  Scriptures  themselves  will  show  that  this  is  not  a  real  woman  here  described  but  a

to

their

the  personification  of

the  astrological  religion  of  Sun  worship

symbol  of
that  we  have  been  studying  about *end* However there is somewhat of a parallel between this prophecy of this lewd woman and the
real life of Semiramis who was the wife of Ninus Nimrod *end* It was Semiramis who in history
was  worshipped  in  Egypt  as  Isis  or  to  the  Babylonians  as  Ishtar  or  to  the  Israelites  as
Ashtaroth or in India Isi or in Rome Cybele or in Mexico Coatlicue All the crafts of the
occult can be traced back to this evil family of Cush Hermes Nimrod Baal and Semiramis
Ishtar *end* As Scripture states Nimrod was the son of Cush who was the son of Ham who was
the son of Noah *end* Genesis  *end*
    Now  in  the  legends  of  Nimrod  who  was  Ninus  to  the  Assyrians  it  is  stated  by  ancient
historians that Ninus the husband of Semiramis  was killed as we have already seen by a
rival god and cut into several pieces *end* Both the Babylonian god Tammuz and the Egyptian god
Osiris  were  worshipped  as
legends  were  killed  by  a  rival  god *end*  In  the  Babylonian  version  Tammuz  was  killed  by  a
"certain king" for trying to introduce the religion of Astrology *end* Who could this "certain king"
be that killed this ringleader of apostasy *end* Who opposed the worship of the God of Noah and
Shem *end* Hislop says these legends of Tammuz' and Osiris' deaths can be traced through history
to Nimrod and Shem Shem is the Biblical lineage from which Christ was born and Shem in
the Egyptian myth was the rival god named Set or Seth or Typhon  who was worshipped
as the god Shom by the people of India  *end*
   So you see all the legends of the Sun-gods can be traced back to the Babylonian religions *end* Hence Bacchus to the Phoenicians Hercules to the Assyrians Dionysus to the Grecians Attis
to the Romans Krishna to the Indians of India Quetzalcoatl to the Mexicans Balder to the
Scandinavians  Pan-ku  to  the  Chinese  and  Pan  to  both  the  ancient  and  modern  Witchcraft
cults are just photocopies of Nimrod as we have already stated many times *end*
    The  various  goddesses  throughout  the  world  also  derived  out  of  the  legends  of  the  first
goddess Semiramis who was the wife of Ninus Nimrod *end* It was Semiramis Ishtar to the
Babylonians who was a witch herself that established the Rite of Sacred Prostitution that
witches
the  Great  Mother
Goddess the Queen of Heaven the goddess of all impurity the goddess of Love and Sex and
also of War and as Athena the goddess of Wisdom *end* It appears that it is this version of the
Greek  goddess  who  is  standing  on  top  of  the  rotunda  of  the  Capitol  of  the  United  States *end* Another  tradition  in  Greece  has  this  pagan  goddess  as  Aphrodite  the  goddess  of  exciting
sexual desires *end*
    During  the  French  Revolution  which  we  will  study  later  the  revolutionaries  banned  all
Christianity and burned Bibles *end* The worship of God was forbidden and the Jacobin Clubs had
legislated within the laws of their new government that the Christian God of the Bible was a
false god *end* In place of the Bible and the worship of Jesus they exalted this same goddess who
was also known as the goddess of Reason and of Liberty *end* This same goddess is standing in
New York Harbor as a gift from France *end*
   Now in Revelation  we read the following "With whom the kings of the earth have
committed fornication and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine
of  her  fornication."  What  is  the  interpretation  according  to  the  Bible  the  meaning  behind
"wine of her fornication?" Turn in your Bibles to Ezekiel the sixteenth chapter and we will
learn the interpretation thereof *end* In Ezekiel - the Lord symbolically describes his chosen
people  as  an  unwanted  baby  on  whom  the  Lord  took  pity  and  raised  up  into  a  beautiful
prosperous kingdom *end* However when the Israelites turned their backs on the Lord and turned
to idolatry the Lord called Israel a "harlot." "But thou didst trust in thine own beauty and
playedst  the  HARLOT  because  of  thy  renown  and  pouredst  out  thy  FORNICATIONS  on
every one that passed by; his it was." Ezekiel  *end*
   Before the Israelites went into the Promised Land the Lord told Moses to instruct them "I
am the Lord your God *end* After the doings of the land of Egypt wherein ye dwelt shall ye not

today  call  "The  Great  Rite."  Semiramis  was  worshipped  as

do and after the doings of the land of Canaan whither I bring you shall ye not do neither
shall ye walk in their ordinances." Leviticus  *end*
    However  anyone  who  has  ever  read  the  Old  Testament  has  learned  that  the  Israelites
mingled with the people of Canaan and learned their customs *end* They took the heathen customs
and mingled them with the sacred things of God *end* Even before they entered into the land of
Canaan when Moses went up Mount Sinai to receive the Ten Commandments the Israelites
fell into idolatry  *end* This may also be seen when Joshua died Judges - *end* After Joshua
died we read in Judges - the following "And the children of Israel did evil in the sight
of  the  Lord  and  served  Baalim *end*  And  they  forsook  the  Lord  God  of  their  Fathers  which
brought them out of the land of Egypt and followed other gods of the gods of the people that
were round about them and bowed themselves unto them and provoked the Lord to anger *end* And they forsook the Lord and served Baal and Ashtaroth *end* And the anger of the Lord was hot
against Israel and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them and he sold
them  into  the  hands  of  their  enemies  round  about  so  that  they  could  not  any  longer  stand
before their enemies."
   The problem of the pagan influences penetrating into the ranks of Israel was because the
leaders of Israel allowed pagan customs little by little to creep in among the sacred things of
God *end* In Ezekiel  we read "Her priests have violated my law and have profaned mine
holy  things  they  have  put  no  difference  between  the  holy  and  profaned  neither  have  they
shewed  difference  between  the  unclean  and  the  clean  and  have  hid  their  eyes  from  my
Sabbaths and I am profaned among them."
   It was the mingling of pagan philosophies within the sacred ordinances and commandments
of our Lord that led Israel to finally abandon the worship of the True God and bow down and
worship images that were symbols of the cosmic gods of Astrology *end* And so is it today *end* The
whole world has been intoxicated with "the wine of her fornication" which means deceived
by the seducing religion and doctrines of the astrological religion of Sun-worship *end*
   You might ask how that could be *end* Well in the book Beware Its Coming - The Antichrist
 published by W.F.G *end* Inc *end* we read
   "In the legend of the Tauric Goddess Diana it is said that every stranger who landed on her
shore was sacrificed on her altar *end* Have you ever wondered what the Christmas Tree has to do
with the Birth of Christ *end* Or the ornaments you place on the tree or the meaning of the word
'YULETIDE?' Or where the tradition of the mistletoe came from and how it became a symbol
of  Christmas *end*  Reader  they  have  nothing  whatsoever  to  do  with  the  birth  of  Jesus  but  are
some of the traditions observed to honor the birth of pagan godchild Tammuz *end* There is no
Scriptural evidence that supports the Birth of Christ as being December ; but history says
December  was kept thousands of years before the Birth of Christ in honor of the pagan
Messiah *end* Another name for Tammuz the pagan god-child was 'Baal-bereth' which means
'Lord of the Fir-Tree.'
   "The Sun-god the Mother goddess and her son according to Babylonian mythology were
mystically changed into trees *end* This is the origin of burning the Yule Log *end* Nimrod deified as
the Sungod was symbolized by a big fir tree stripped of all its branches and cut almost to the
ground *end* But the great serpent which symbolized the life restorer whose name is Aesculapius
twists  itself  around  the  dead  stock  and  lo  at  its  side  a  young  tree  - a  tree  of  an  entirely
different kind which is destined never to be cut down by hostile power; even the palm tree
the well known symbol of victory *end* People of Aryan stock who believed that the oak tree was a
symbol of Zeus or Jupiter believed that this Branch was of Mistletoe which grew on the oak
tree and to be kissed under the mistletoe would insure fertility *end* The Branch was a name given
to the Christ Isaiah  - 'AND THERE SHALL COME FORTH A ROD OUT OF THE
STEM OF JESSE AND A BRANCH SHALL GROW OUT OF HIS ROOTS.'
   "Now take the word 'Yuletide.' The word yule is as Babylonian as Tammuz *end* The word yule
is  the  Chaldee  word  for  infant  or  little  child  and  the    of  December  was  called  by  the

pagan Anglo-Saxons'Yule-day' or Child's Day *end* The pagan Egyptians and the Persians both
observed the  of December as the birthday of their god *end*
   "In Germanic Mythology they too had a supreme god to whom they gave sacrifice *end* These
warlike  people  promised  their  god  whose  name  was  TIWAZ  that  if  he  would  give  them
victory over their enemy they would give to their god all the spoils of the battle *end* Like the
Babylonians  they  believed  their  gods  could  transform  themselves  into  trees *end*  If  the  god
answered their prayers they took their dead victims along with the spoils of war and dragged
them to their sacred grove and there hung them on their sacred trees *end* Such offerings have
been recovered from the bogs in Germany *end* This beget the origin of hanging ornaments from
the Christmas Tree *end*
the  pagan  Festival  of
    "Little  sheep  of
Christmas *end*  The  World  is  commemorating  the  Birth  of  Christ  not  Tammuz *end*  There  is  an
advantage  during  the  Christmas  season  to  preach  the  real  Jesus  of  the  Bible *end*  However  we
should keep ourselves from the vanities of the pagan Festival not to mention the cost and the
deaths caused by lighted Christmas Trees *end*
   "There is however an opportunity during the Christmas Season with its beautiful music to
make others aware that Christ is no longer a helpless babe in a manger but is the Saviour of
the  world  the  King  of  kings  Lord  of  lords *end*  Many  who  think  the  Bible  and  its  message  is
foolishness can be reached during the Christmas Season where it would be almost impossible
to talk to them at another time *end* Even the Christmas Tree can be used to teach the children a
great lesson *end* The children should be taught that it is a historical fact that placing bulbs tinsel
and lights on a Christmas Tree is pure pagan heathenism *end*
    "This  pagan  custom  got  its  start  from  killing  enemies  and  hanging  their  heads  and  their
spoils from pagan sacred trees *end* It would not be a sin if an evergreen tree was set up in the
church during the Christmas Season if it was done to be an object lesson *end* If the parents would
take  the  money  they  spend  each  year  on  Christmas  trees  bulbs  lights  and   expensive
presents  and give the money as an offering to advance the preaching of the Gospel would
not the Lord be pleased with such a self-sacrifice?"
   There are more shocking facts about pagan customs that have been adopted into Christianity
that will be revealed as we continue *end* In the book of Job we read "If I beheld the Sun when it
shined or the moon walking in brightness; And my heart hath been secretly enticed or my
mouth hath kissed my hand This also were an iniquity to be punished by the Judge For I
should have denied the God that is above." Job - *end*
   Hence the symbolic interpretation applied to this Harlot found in Revelation  Mystery
Babylon  the  Great  The  Mother  of  Harlots  is  Satan's  great  religious  system  with  its  many
various sects that taught the world to obey the precepts of the astrological worship of the Sun
Moon and the Stars *end*
   The Bible says in I Corinthians  "Now all these things happened unto them for
ensamples and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are
come *end* Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall." The records of the
history of Israel are types that will repeat themselves until Christ comes *end* We are warned in the
Bible to take heed to Israel's fall lest we fall *end* It appears from Scriptures that Israel adopted all
the  main  versions  of  the  Babylonian  idolatry  in  her  apostasy *end*   "Thou  has  also  committed
fornication  with   the  Egyptians  thy  neighbours  great  of  the  flesh;  and  hast  increased  thy
whoredoms  to  provoke  me  to  anger *end*  Behold  therefore  I  have  stretched  out  my  hand  over
thee and have diminished thine ordinary food and delivered thee unto the will of them that
hate  thee  the  daughters  of  the  Philistines  which  are  ashamed  of  thy  lewd  way *end*  Thou  hast
played the whore also with the Assyrians because thou wast unsatiable Yea thou hast played
the  unsatiable  Yea  thou  hast  played  the  HARLOT  with  them  and  yet  couldest  not  be
satisfied *end* Thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of Canaan unto Chaldea
and yet thou was not satisfied herewith." Ezekiel   *end*

its  ruins *end*  "Thus  he  said  The  fourth  beast  Rome  shall  be

   Now it is time to see from Scripture what the symbol of the Beast from the Bottomless Pit
means that is carrying this Mother of Harlots *end* A Beast in prophecy is a symbol of a "political
power" or "kingdom" as it clearly shows in Daniel - - *end* Daniel saw four great beasts
and the angel said "These great beasts which are four ARE FOUR KINGS which shall arise
out of the Earth." Daniel  *end*
   As the Scriptures reveal the symbolic beasts here represent four pagan nations that would
arise in sequence taking dominion or ruling over the whole known world at that time *end* These
kings were recorded in history as
.Babylonian Empire  BC to  BC the Lion *end*  .Medo-Persian Empire  BC to
BC the Bear *end*  .Grecian Empire  BC to  BC the Leopard   .Roman Empire  BC
to  AD the Dragon *end*  When Rome fell in  AD it was to have Ten Nations that would
arise  out  of
the  FOURTH
KINGDOM upon earth which shall be diverse from all kingdoms and shall devour the whole
earth and shall tread it down and break it in pieces *end* And the Ten Horns out of this kingdom
are TEN KINGS that shall arise; and another shall rise after  them; and he shall be diverse
from the first and he shall subdue three kings." Daniel  *end*
    These  Ten  Nations  are  also  recorded  history  now  as  the  prophecy  of  Daniel  predicted
hundreds of years earlier *end* They were the following
.Angle-Saxons  .Franks  .Alemanni  .Lombards  .strogoths  .Visigoths  .Burgundians
.Vandals  .Suevi .Heruli *end*
   After these Ten Nations would become history Daniel the Prophet foretold another Little
Horn Nation was to come up among these Ten Nations and would war with them and would
actually destroy three of the Ten Nations *end* They would be rooted out of that area called Europe
today *end* And this is precisely what happened *end* This Little Horn Nation destroyed the nations
of the Heruli in  AD the Vandals in  AD and the last of the three the Ostrogoths lost
their last battle with this Little Horn Nation in  AD and were eventually driven out of
Italy by  AD *end* However it was in  AD that paved the way for this little Nation to take
dominion of that area that would become Europe *end* In Daniel  we read about this little horn
"I  considered  the  horns  and  behold  there  came  up  among  them  another  LITTLE  HORN
before whom there were THREE OF THE FIRST HORNS PLUCKED UP BY THE ROOTS
and Behold in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man and a mouth speaking great things."
It  is  a  historical  fact  that  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  destroyed  the  nations  of  the  Heruli
Vandals and the Ostrogoths *end* Although it was not the Papacy who actually did the fighting it
was the Papacy who hired mercenaries to destroy them *end* For more facts about the history of
the  prophecy  of  Daniel  the    Chapter  may  we  suggest  you  order  a  copy  of  Beware  It's
Coming - The Antichrist  from our catalogue which is found in the back of this book *end*
    Now  in  Daniel    it  lists  four  things  that  the  Little  Horn  Papacy  was  predicted  in
prophecy to do after destroying the Heruli Vandals and the Ostrogoths *end* "And he shall speak
great words against the most High and shall wear out the saints of the most High and think to
change  times  and  laws  and  they  shall  be  given  into  his  hand  until  a  time  times  and  the
dividing of time."
   To see how the Papacy has fulfilled the first prediction Daniel described here in  all
one has to do is to pick up a local newspaper and read the words the Papacy speaks when they
exalt  their  present  Pope *end*  He  is  hailed  as  the  Vicar  of  God  Christ  in  the  Flesh *end*  Is  this  not
blasphemy *end* All one needs to do to see how the Papacy would wear out the saints of the most
high is to pick up an encyclopedia and read about the inquisitions during the Medieval Age *end* One  had  merely  to  be  accused  of  heresy  against  papal  doctrine  or  authority  and  this  was
enough to burn at the stake *end* It was the Papacy not Christ or His Apostles that changed the
original  day  of  worship  the  Seventh  Day  into  the  holy  day  of  the  Sun-god  called  today
Sunday the first day of the week *end* We will study this change in more detail later on *end*
   Now coming back to the last part of Daniel's prophecy of the Papacy as the Little Horn

Daniel said the Little Horn  would continue  "until a time times and  the dividing of time."
To figure the amount of time the Papacy would commit blasphemy against the Most High to
wear out the saints of the Most High and would think to change times and laws we need to
read Numbers  and Ezekiel  "After the number of the days in which ye searched the
land  even  forty  days  EACH  DAY  FOR  A  YEAR  shall  ye  bear  your  iniquities  EVEN
FORTY YEARS and ye shall know my breach of promise."
   In Jewish prophecy  a day is  counted as a year as shown above *end* Now in Daniel  the
religious dictatorship of the Papacy was to be for a "time times and the dividing of time." A
time in Jewish prophecy represents  days of the Jewish calendar *end* So a day in prophecy
equals also one year Ezekiel  and since a time equals  days in one Jewish year Times
would be two years or  days *end* Dividing of time equals half a year or half of  days
which would be  days *end* Now in Jewish prophecy a day is also counted as one year as in
Ezekiel  and Numbers  *end*
   Here is a better way of explaining this
   TIME =  days or one year in prochecy
   TIMES =  days or two years in prophecy
   / TIME =   days or / year in prophecy
   TIME= TIMES=  / TIME=  with a total of ./ YEARS =
   The starting point for the time times and the dividing of time or the  years of the
Papal Religious Dictatorship would be when the last of the Three Kingdoms was destroyed *end* This Last Kingdom was the Ostrogoths *end* The decisive battle between the papal forces and the
Ostrogoths  was  in    AD *end*  It  was  then  that  the  Papacy  began  to  claim  they  were  the
"Corrector of Heretics"; hence this began the tyrannical religious dictatorship of the Roman
Catholic Church  *end*
    It  was  not  until  the  year    AD  that  the  Papacy  completely  lost  control  to  dictate  its
authority to the world *end* General Berthier from France during the Napoleonic Wars was sent to
the  Vatican  in    to  seize  Pope  Plus  VI  and  he  was  dethroned  and  banished  into  exile
where he later died."
    From  the  year    AD  to    AD  is  actually    years  as  the  prophecy  of  Daniel
predicted *end* Here is a diagram of the complete prophecy of Daniel the  chapter *end* The diagram
covers a complete picture of the kingdoms of the world that were foretold from Babylon's
BC takeover of the known world down through the centuries to the time when Pope plus IV
was dethroned *end*
  Babylonian         Medo-Persian         Grecian Empire         Roman Empire              Papacy
- BC         - BC             - BC         BC- AD       -  AD
   Now that we have learned what a beast is symbolic of in Scripture let us again examine the
 chapter of Revelation *end* As stated before Babylon the Great represents ALL religions that
teach Babylonlan doctrines derived from the astrological worship of the Sun-god *end* This covers
all the pagan religions and ALL Christian churches that have mingled heathenism with the
sacred things of God *end* "Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of devils; ye cannot
be partakers of the Lord's table and of the table of devils." .Corinthians  *end*
    Now  it's  time  to  look  at  the  Beast  that  ascends  out  of  the  Bottomless  Pit  that  the  false
religious systems of the World are riding on *end* In Revelation - we read the following
"And the angel said unto me Wherefore didst thou marvel *end* I will tell thee the mystery of the
woman and of the beast that carrieth her which hath the seven heads and ten horns *end* The beast
that  thou  sawest  was  and  is  not;  and  shall  ascend  out  of  the  bottomless  pit  and  go  into
perdition and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the
book of life from the foundation of the world when they behold the beast that was and is not
and yet is *end* And here is the mind which hath wisdom *end* The seven heads are seven mountains
on which the woman sitteth *end* And there are seven kings five are fallen and one is and the
other is not yet come; and when he cometh he must continue a short space *end* And the beast that

the  kings  of

was and is not even he is the eighth and is of the seven and goeth into perdition *end* And the ten
horns which thou sawest are ten kings which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive
power as kings one hour with the beast *end* These have one mind and shall give their power and
strength unto the beast *end* THESE SHALL MAKE WAR WITH THE LAMB and the LAMB
SHALL  OVEACOME  THEM  FOR  HE  IS  LORD  OF  LORDS  AND  KING  OF  KINGS
AND THEY THAT ARE WITH HIM ARE CALLED AND FAITHFUL *end* And he said unto
me The waters which thou sawest where the whore sitteth are peoples and multitudes and
nations and tongues *end* And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast these shall hate the
whore and shall make her desolate and naked and shall eat her flesh and burn her with fire *end* For God hath put in their hearts to fulfill his will and to agree and give their kingdom unto
the beast until the words of God shall be fulfilled *end* And the woman which thou sawest is that
great  city  which  reigneth  over
the  earth."  This  prophecy  symbolizing  a
confederacy of false religious systems and political powers uniting against Jesus the Lamb
and His people is for us who live in these closing days of this world's history *end* The Key that
unlocks this prophecy and shows who this beast is that ascends out of the Bottomless Pit and
when it makes its appearance is in Revelation the  chapter *end* We will compare prophecies
of  Revelation  the    chapter  with  Revelation  the    chapter *end*  In  Revelation  the
chapter we read the following "And there was given me a reed like unto a rod and the angel
stood  saying  Rise  and  measure  the  temple  of  God  and  the  altar  and  them  that  worship
therein *end* But the court which is without the temple leave out and measure it not for it is given
unto the Gentiles and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months *end* And I
will  give  power  unto  my  TWO  WITNESSES  and  they  shall  prophesy  a  thousand  two
hundred and threescore days clothed in sackcloth *end* These are the two olive trees and the two
candlesticks standing before the God of earth *end* And if any man will hurt them fire proceedeth
out of their mouth and devoureth their enemies and if any man will hurt them he must in
this manner be killed *end* These have power to shut heaven that it rain not in the days of their
prophecy and have power over the waters to turn them to blood and to smite the earth with
all plagues as often as they will *end* And when they shall have finished their testimony the beast
that  ascendeth  out  of  the  Bottomless  Pit  SHALL  MAKE  WAR  AGAINST  THEM  AND
SHALL  OVERCOME  THEM  AND  KILL  THEM *end*  And  their  dead  bodies  shall  lie  in  the
street of the great city which spiritually is called Sodom and  Egypt  where also our Lord
was crucified *end* And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their
dead bodies THREE DAYS AND AN HALF and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put
in graves *end* And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them and make merry and
shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the
earth *end* And after THREE DAYS AND AN HALF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE from God entered
into them and they stood upon  their feet; and great fear  fell upon them which saw them *end* And
they heard a great Voice from heaven saying unto them Come up hither *end* And they ascended
up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them *end* And the same hour was there a great
earthquake and the tenth part of the city fell and in the earthquake were slain of men seven
thousand and the remnant were affrighted and gave glory to the God of heaven *end* The second
woe is past; and behold the third woe cometh quickly *end* And the seventh angel sounded; and
there were great voices in heaven saying THE KINGDOMS OF THIS WORLD ARE NOW
BECOME THE KINGDOMS OF OUR LORD AND OF HIS CHRIST; AND HE SHALL
REIGN FOR EVER AND EVER *end* And the four and twenty elders which sat before God on
their seats fell upon their faces and worshipped God Saying We give thee thanks O Lord
God Almighty which art and was and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great
power and hast reigned *end* And the notions were angry and thy wrath is come and the time of
the dead that they should be judged and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the
prophets  and  to  the  saints  and  them  that  fear  thy  name  small  and  great;  and  shouldest
DESTROY THEM WHICH  DESTROY THE EARTH *end* And the temple of God was opened

in heaven and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament and there were lightnings
and voices and thunderings and an earthquake and great hail."
   This prophecy will take us from the time the Papacy began to lose its controlling power to
dictate to the world until the Second Coming of Jesus *end* In Revelation - it says "And
there was given me a reed like unto a rod and the angel stood saying Rise and measure the
temple of God and the altar and they that worship therein *end* But the court which is without the
temple leave out and measure it not for it is given unto the Gentiles and the holy city shall
they tread under foot FORTY AND  TWO  MONTHS *end* And I will give power unto my  TWO
WITNESSES  AND   THEY  SHALL   PROPHESY  A   THOUSAND   TWO  HUNDRED
AND  THREESCORE  DAYS  CLOTHED  IN  SACKCLOTH *end*  These  are  the  TWO  OLIVE
TREES and the TWO CANDLESTICKS standing before God of earth *end* And if any man will
hurt them fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth their enemies And if any man
will hurt them he must in this manner be killed." Again we see this time period of  days
which in prophecy represents  years Numbers ; Ezekiel  *end* The periods of
days and  months are the same *end* The ancient Jewish calendar has  days in a year and
days in a month *end* Forty two months equals  days years in Bible prophecy *end*
                  months days =  years
    This  prophecy  is  the  same  time  period  we  studied  in  Daniel    the  time  times  and
dividing of time that the Papacy was foretold to "speak greet words against the Most High
wear out the saints of the Most High think to change times and laws." This time period as we
examined started in the year  AD and reached up through the centuries until  AD
when  the  French  army  seized  Pope  Plus  VI  and  sent  him  into  exile  where  he  died *end*  Even
though  another  Pope  was  reinstated  soon  afterwards  the  Papacy  lost  its  control  to  run  the
affairs of the world *end*
   During  this time of  papal persecution the Holy Scriptures  were kept from  the ordinary
people *end*  The  Papacy  claimed  only  priests  could
the
Scriptures were read it was usually given in Latin which the great masses didn't understand *end* The suppression of the Holy Scriptures by  the Papacy  was also foretold in the symbols of
the two witnesses who were also symbolized as two olive trees or two candlesticks *end* "...and I
will give power unto my  TWO WITNESSES and they shall prophesy a THOUSAND TWO
HUNDRED  AND THREESCORE DAYS  years clothed in sackcloth *end* These are the
TWO  TREES  AND  THE  TWO  CANDLESTICKS  STANDING  BEFORE  GOD  of  the
earth." Revelation . *end*
   The most popular opinion found among the Doctors of Theology is that the two witnesses
are two prophets that shall come during the Great Tribulation Period while some say that this
prophecy of the two witnesses has a two-fold meaning *end* However the Scriptures and recorded
history show that the prophecy about the two witnesses has indeed come to pass *end*
   Jesus our Lord said "And this Gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for
a  WITNESS  UNTO  ALL  NATIONS  and  then  shall  the  end  come."  Matthew   *end*  The
Gospel  taught  from  the  Scriptures  was  to  be  a  witness  to  all  nations  about  the  loving  and
saving  power  of  Jesus  Christ *end*  It  gives  its  hearers  correction  in  right  doing *end*  It  gives  its
believers hope for the future and the promise of forgiveness for past sins through the sacrifice
of Christ's death *end* "And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the Devil who
are taken captive by him at his will." .Timothy  *end*
   However when the Roman Catholic Church became a religious dictatorship the Scriptures
were hidden from the vast population and catechism was substituted instead of Bible study *end* The Gospel of the Bible became mingled with the pagan philosophies of Sun worship *end* The
worship of the pagan Mother goddess became the idol of the Roman Catholic Church through
the worship of the Virgin Mary.' When the Gospel became perverted through Romanism God
always  had  a  remnant  people  who  were  teaching  the  True  Faith  during  the    years  the
Papacy cast the Truth to the ground *end* These faithful followers of Jesus were hunted down by

the  Scriptures  and  when

    When  those  faithful  servants  who  proclaimed  the  sacred  truths  from  the  Old  and  New

    Sackcloth  was  worn  by
times  of
.Chronicles  ; Isaiah  *end* The sackcloth here mentioned in Revelation  was to
mourn the supression of the Old and New Testament by the papal authorities during the
years *end* The two witnesses the two olive trees or the two candlesticks represented the light the
Scripture gives its reader *end*
   The Olive Tree was the Israelites' source of oil to anoint their kings and priests *end* Oil has
often  in  Biblical  language  been  a  symbol  of  the  Holy  Spirit *end*  See  Zechariah  - *end*  The
Candlestick  represents  the  illumination  a  searcher  of  Truth  receives  in  the  heart  when  he
makes the Word of God his standard to measure Truth to live by *end* "Thy word is a LAMP unto

   "All scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for

   "And if any man will hurt them fire proceedeth out of their mouths and devoureth their
enemies and if any man will hurt them he must in this manner be killed *end* These have power
to shut heaven that it rain not in the days of their prophecy *end* And have power over waters to
turn them to blood and to smite the earth with all plagues as often as they will." Revelation
 *end*
    This  prophecy  is  a  parallel  with  that  of  Jesus  in  Revelation   *end*  "For  I  testify  unto
every man that heareth the words of this prophecy of this book If any man shall add unto
these things God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book And if any man
shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy God shall take away his part out
of the book of life and out of the Holy City and from the things which are written in this
book."
   This will be the fate of ALL those who tamper with the sacred Scripture *end* These warnings
were given by God to warn men against changing or adding to anything written in the Holy
Scriptures *end*  The  Scriptures  reveal  God's  plan  for  man  from  the  beginning  of  creation  until
Christ's Second Coming and also how he will provide for man after this Age *end* The Scriptures
were given for man as a guide throughout his life to lead him through the gates of the New
Jerusalem where he will dwell with God himself *end* Revelation - *end*
    "And  when  they  shall  have  finished  their  testimony  the  beast  that  ascendeth  out  of  the
Bottomless  Pit  shall  make  war  against  them  and  shall  overcome  them  and  kill  them *end*  And
their  dead  bodies  shall   lie  in  the  streets  of  the  great  city  which  SPIRITUALLY  is  called
Sodom and Egypt where also our Lord was crucified." Revelation  *end*
   This beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit is often confused with the Papacy but
this is not a prophecy of the Papacy since this prophecy starts near the end of the  years *end* For  years the Papacy did exactly what was foretold in Daniel  - *end* However the
Papacy never made war on the Scriptures she just locked them up in an unknown tongue *end*
   This Beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit is another political power that was to
take the place of the Papacy in France that Satan would use to try to destroy the word of God *end* Ellen  G *end*  White  in  her  multimillion  seller  The  Great  Controversy  says  that  this  beast  that

many of the nations of Europe the powers that ruled in church and state had for centuries been
controled  by  Satan  through  the  medium  of  the  papacy *end*  But  here  is  brought  to  view  a  new
manifestation of satanic power." Ellen White goes on to say
   "According to the words of the prophet then a little before the year  some power of
satanic origin and character would rise to make war upon the Bible *end* And in the land where the
testimony  of  God's  two  witnesses  should  thus  be  silenced  there  would  be  manifest  the
atheism of the Pharoah and the licentiousness of Sodom *end*

   However it was this Witchcraft school called the illuminati of Bavaria that was predicted to

forces that actually destroyed millions of  lives and left his mark of evil to be felt in all future
generations  without  even  being  heard  of  by  most  people *end*  Winrod  on  page    of  his  book
quotes from a letter that Adam Weishaupt wrote to an intimate friend
   "My circumstances necessitate that I should remain hidden from most of the members as
long as I live *end* I am obliged to do everything through five or six persons."
   On another occasion he said "...one must show how easy it would be for one clever head to
direct hundreds of thousands of men." Again he wrote "I have two immediately below me
into which I breathe my whole spirit and each of these two has again two others and so on *end* In this way I can set a thousand men in motion and on fire in the simplest manner and in this
way one must impart orders and operate on politics." Weishaupt recruited into his ranks as
many young men of wealth and position as possible *end* Within four or five years Weishaupt's
Illuminati became very powerful and even had his members directing the affairs of Germany *end* Weishaupt's  goal  was

    To  spread  his  Order  and  give  the  Illuminati  higher  influence  in  the  world  and  because
Freemasonry  is  akin  to  Illuminism  Weishaupt  connected  with  the  Masonic  Institution *end*  He
was initiated in  into Freemasonry in a Lodge at Munich  that he planned to use to

spreading their poison *end* They did this by using code names to communicate where they were *end* For
the
fictitious name of Eleusis; Austria was Egypt Munich was  called Athens and Vienna was
Rome *end* The Illuminati invented its own calendar and the names of the months were also given
code names such as Dimeh for January and Bemeh for February  *end*
    Because  of  Martin  Luther's  rejection  of  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  in    and  the
corruption and strife within the Roman Catholic Church itself the Papacy lost a great deal of
its authority to dictate to the world *end* Before Adam Weishaupt formed his Order of Illuminati in
 Free Thinking or the Encyclopedists were already preaching a philosophy against the
tyranny  and  fanaticism  of  the  Roman  Catholic  Church *end*  One  such  voice  heard  in  the  third
quarter  of  the    century  was  a  French  author  philosopher  and  apostle  of  Free  Thought
Liberty named Voltaire - *end* Even though the Roman Catholic Church lost much of
its power before  when Pope Plus VI was dethroned  Voltaire still lived in an age
when the press did not exist thought was not free; and men were not equal before the Civil
Law *end*
   Although professing belief in a Supreme Being or a god he denied the existence of Jesus
Christ and the authority of the Bible  *end* He became a staunch opposer of papal Christianity
and helped to promote the  Encyclopedis ou Dictionnaire Raisonne des Sciences des Arts et
des Metier  vols *end* -; Supplement  vols *end* - table analytique  vols *end*  to
which he was a contributor and which is known to us today as the Encyclopedia *end*

   There was an army of writers used by Lucifer in the  century  to poison the minds of the
French  people  against  Christianity  as  a  whole  nation *end*  Voltaire  once  boastingly  said  "I  am
weary  of  hearing  people  repeat  that  twelve  men  established  the  Christian  religion *end*  I  will
PROVE that one man may suffice to overthrow it"  *end*
   Actually the ideas of the Enlightenment illuminati was a continuation of the Renaissance
that was borrowed from the Greek philosopher Plato - BC *end* Weishaupt's idealism was
borrowed also from such writers in the  century as Descartes and Bayle in France Grotius
in Holland Leibnitz in Germany Locks in England  *end*

the

spirit  OF  THE

to  Christianity  being  prohibited  by  state

the  Declaration  of  independence *end*  It  was  our  Lord  however  that  took  this  confusion  and
molded it into a protective shield against both civil and religious persecution
   Now coming back to the prophecy about the illuminati making avowed war on the Bible
Two Witnesses we read in Revelation - "And they of the people and kindreds and
tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and on half and shall not suffer
their dead bodies to be put in graves *end* And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over
them  and  make  merry  and  shall  send  gifts  one  to  another;  because  these  two  prophets
tormented  them  that  dwelt  on  the  earth *end*  And  after  THREE  DAYS  AND  AN  HALF  THE
SPIRIT OF LIFE FROM GOD entered into them and they stood upon their feet; and great
fear fell upon them which saw them *end* And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto
them Come up hither *end* And they ascended up in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them."
    There  may  have  been  many  minor  reasons  why  France  became  a  habitation  of  Atheists
during the French Revolution with its ./ year "Reign of Terror" however it actually began
because of Roman Catholic suppression of the Scriptures *end* Christ was not preached as set forth
in the Gospel *end* It was just the opposite *end* Jesus was misrepresented among the vast multitudes in
France  which
the  false
presentation of the Gospel by the Papacy the suppression of the Scriptures the tyranny and
fanaticism of the Papacy an army of atheists was able to gain sympathy for their cause and
the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit was able to make war on the Bible Two
Witnesses  and  overcome  it *end*  Here  we  find  the  reason  the  Papacy  lost  its  dictatorial  power *end* This set the stage for not only destroying Christianity in France at that era of time but also set
the  stage  for  the  forces  of  France  to  march into  Vatican  City  and  dethrone  the  Pope  when
Napoleon came on the scene after the Revolution *end*
   Writers have hailed the French Revolution as the dawning of a new era but it actually was
the  birth  of  another  terrible  deception  of  the  Seven  Headed  Dragon  Lucifer  to  destroy
millions of human lives *end* When Lucifer saw that the Papacy's power was coming to an end as
predicted in Daniel  he simply raised up another movement to destroy man that would
continue until the Papacy's power is restored as predicted in Revelation  which we will
later study *end*
    Now  the  Illuminati  movement  that  shall  make  war  on  the  Lamb  but  the  Lamb  shall
overcome  them  Revelation    is  not  to  become  world  wide  until  the  second  beast  of
Revelation - begins to emerge and speak as a dragon *end* This as we will learn later is
the  power  of  Apostate  Protestantism
in  America *end*  But  before  we  can  understand  how
illuminism  Catholicism  and  Apostate  Protestantism  shall  go  forth  into  the  world  to  unite
them  against  the  Real  Jesus  of  the  Bible  we  need  to  know  what  name  the  Illuminati  are
operating under today *end*
   As stated before Adam Weishaupt connected with the Masonic Lodge in  *end* He posed at
first  among  the  Freemasons  as  a  reformer  in  religion  and  a  liberal  in  politics *end*  Because
Freemasonry  was  also  anti-papal  Weishaupt's  anti-papacy  policies
the
popular
Illuminati registers in Germany *end* Among those were some of the most distinguished aristocrats
of that Country  *end*
    It  is  quite  apparent  that  the  men  of  the  Order  of  Freemasonry  that  joined  Weishaupt's
Illuminati had  no idea of  what trap they had fallen into *end* Very few Masons understood  what
Adam Weishaupt's plans were in the beginning as very few Masons today understand what
their own organization teaches *end* Weishaupt penetrated into the Freemasonry organization with
all the shrewdness and subtlety that he learned from once being a Jesuit priest *end*
   Some historians have written that the French Revolution was not premeditated *end* Some will
say  that  the  French  Revolution  emerged  only  from  a  political  crisis  that  coincided  with  an
economic breakdown *end* This economic breakdown generated unrest and riots which even the
French army could not quell *end* It was this some historian will argue that made the people of

   What these historians say is true in part only *end* The parts of history some historians fail to see
or  leave  out  is  actually  what  caused  the  people  in  the  first  place  to  accept  this  spirit  of
Illuminism *end* As stated before it was the suppression of the Bible the fanatical oppression of
the Roman Catholic Church that actually generated the spark that eventually led the French
people to reject Christianity and publicly burn their Bibles *end* History records that the events that
led up to the French Revolution were caused  by anarchy *end* The citizens became divided into a
medley of hate factions  that were struggling for power trying to exterminate each other  *end* But  before  this  it  was  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  who  slaughtered  French  citizens  by
thousands that kindled a hatred for Christianity *end* The murderous character of the Papacy was
seen  in  France *end*  In    AD  Roman  Catholics  tried  in  one  sweep  to  murder  all  of  the
Protestants in France *end* This is known in history as the St *end* Bartholomew Massacre *end* Within the
space of one month  Protestants are said to have been slain in France *end* All told there
were over  *end* The Cardinal of Lorraine gave  crowns as a reward to the person who
brought the news to the Vatican  *end*
   Here the reader may understand more clearly Revelation  "where also our Lord was
crucified." "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have
done it unto me." Matthew  *end*
   When the Papacy killed the Protestants in the streets of Paris they also were destroying the
Temple that Jesus dwelt in and saith the Lord "YE HAVE DONE IT UNTO ME."
   During the Revolution France was reduced to a state of moral debasement similar to that of
the city of Sodom in Lot's time *end* She also had the same spirit of Atheism within her as did the
Pharoah  of  Egypt  in  Moses'  day *end*  Both  the  sins  of  Sodom  licentiousness  and  of  Egypt
Atheism France was predicted to have in Revelation  *end* At the closing of the  years
the Two Witnesses Old and New Testaments were to finish their testimony  *end* And it was
from  here  that  illuminism  began  to  emerge  and  overcome  Christianity *end*  History  calls  this
movement of Illuminism Atheism "The Jacobin CIubs"  *end*
    The  Jacobin  Clubs  in  France  were  the  aristocratic  terrorists  who  spearheaded  the  French
Revolution which sent King Louis XVI on January st  to the guillotine *end* However
most historians leave out who was really giving orders to Danton Marat and Robespierre the
leaders  of  the  Jacobin  Clubs *end*  It  was  the  Jacobin  Clubs  that  actually  abolished  Christianity
through  the  National  Assembly  and  established  the  worship  of  the  goddess  of  Reason  or
Liberty *end*
   The name "Jacobin" derived from the name of the convent these aristocratic terrorists used
to secretly plot the overthrow of King Louis XVI *end* The convent was called Jacobin Dominican
Convent  *end* They were also known as the Society of the Friends of the Constitution and
were  soon  organized  in  every  important  town  in  France *end*  They  were  the  most  wealthy  and
influential  people  in  France *end*  They  had  as  many  as    members  at  the  height  of  the
influence in -  *end*
    The  truth  is  this  aristrocratic  terrorist  movement  called  the  Jacobin  Club  was  actually
French illuminists operating under a different name *end*
   As established earlier Adam Weishaupt became a Mason in  for the sole purpose of
using  that  organization  as  a  tool  for  boring  into  the  high  levels  of  government  by  simply
replacing Freemasons who already sat in these positions *end*
    With  an  inexhaustible  talent  for  charlatanry  and  a  well  planned  system  of  espionage
Weishaupt's disciples infiltrated into the high levels of the governments in Germany France
England Belgium Holland Denmark Sweden Poland Hungary and Italy *end* However it was
Baron  Von  Knigge  who  joined  the  Illuminati  in    that  gave  this  organization  its  rapid
expansion not Adam Weishaupt *end*
   Freemasons like all Secret Societies choose to remain obscure and do not like to attract
the  Secret  Society  of
attention *end*  Because

Illuminati  was  a  Secret  Society  within

in  Scripture

to  continue  from

the  hardest  blow

Freeemasonry  even  though  they  had  penetrated  into  the  high  levels  of  Europe  very  few
indeed ever heard of them *end* However shortly before the Revolution took place in France two
hard  blows  would  land  on  the  heads  of  Adam  Weishaupt  and  his  co-conspirators *end*  The
Freemasons were not long in hearing rumors about the true nature of Weishaupt's plans  to
capture their whole organization *end* When the Freemasons began to get wind of Weishaupt's true
purposes  a  chief  council  was  held  to  examine  the  nature  of  the  Illuminati  by  top  ranking
Freemasons *end* A conference of Masons was held in  at which time Weishaupt and Von
Knigge attended  *end* But it wasn't until Weishaupt and Von Knigge had a falling out that led
to  Von  Knigge  leaving  the  Order  that  Weishaupt  began  to  have  exposure  and  a  threat  of
internal strife within the illuminati *end*
   A contest between Weishaupt and Von Knigge about who was to be the Rex or King of this
Secret  revolutionary  movement  was  the  real  motive  for  Von  Knigge  leaving  it *end*  After  Von
Knigge
to  Weishaupt's  Luciferian  Conspiracy  was
received in  *end* One of Weishaupt's coconspirators named Lanze was struck by lightning
while en route from Frankfurt Germany to deliver documents to Robespierre the head of the
Jacobin Clubs at that time *end* The documents that Lanze was carrying had important information
about the Order of the Illuminati and its plans of not only destroying the French government
through riots and revolutions but also governments of the world as well  *end* This is how we
today have information about this beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit *end* All of the
papers Lanze was carrying fell into the hands of the Bavarian Government and the authorities
ordered the police to raid the headquarters of the Illuminati in Germany *end* Adam Weishaupt had
to escape for his life  and all documentive evidence that the Order of the illuminati was a
dangerous  international  terrorist  group  was  brought  to  the  attention  of  many  countries  in
Europe *end* However the warnings fell on deaf ears as they will in our day *end* When the Word of
God was rejected and spiritualism took its place France fell into a degrading worship of the
goddess of Reason *end* This period of time in history is also known as the Age of Reason or the
Reign of Terror *end* And interestingly enough the Reign of Terror lasted ./ years as predicted
in Revelation  "After three days and a half prophetic years the Spirit of life from God
entered into them Old and New Testaments and they stood upon their feet."
   The beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit was a political power that ascended out of
Witchcraft  made  open  avowed  war  on
the  French
the  French  Revolution  and
Revolution  and
eventually spread to every corner of the habitable globe *end*
   To point out how the same rebellious spirit of Nimrod and how his hatred towards the Lord
of the Sabbath could be seen also in the Illuminati of the  century Uriah Smith in his
book Daniel and the Revelation p *end*  quotes a priest of Illuminism that was a well known
comedian in France at that time "God *end* if you exist .. *end* avenge your injured name *end* I bid you
defiance *end* You remain silent; you dare not launch your thunders; who after this will believe in
your existence?" Daniel and the Revelotion Smith Southern Publishing Association  p *end*  *end*
    In   the  next  chapter   we  will  continue  to  show   this  gradual   Luciferian  Conspiracy  to
overthrow Christianity and all governments of the world symbolized in Scripture as the beast
that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit Illuminati and how it can be traced through various
names and guises starting from the French Revolution to our present day *end*
   The anarchy that was displayed in the streets of Paris through the efforts of this Antichrist
movement will be seen in this country *end* Ellen White in her book Education p *end*  saw this
anarchy was soon to become a world-wide Conspiracy *end* She states
   "At the same time anarchy is seeking to sweep away all law not only divine but human *end* The centralization of wealth and power; the vast combinations for the enriching of the few at
the expense of many; the combinations of the poorer classes for the defense of their interests
and claims; the spirit of unrest of riot and bloodshed; the  world-wide  dissemination of the

the  Bible  and  Christianity  caused

same teachings that led to the French Revolution - All are tending to involve the whole world
in a struggle similar to that which convulsed France."

   The ideas Lenin developed were directly from the Karl Marx Communist Manifesto and the

best  seller  None  Dare  Call  It  Conspiracy  states  the  following  about  Marx's  Communist
Manifesto
    "If  you  study  Marx  Communist  Manifesto  you  will  find  that  in  essence  Marx  said  the

elimination  of  all  right  to  private  property *end*   *end*  The  dissolution  of  the  family  unit  and   *end* Destruction of what Marx referred to as the 'opiate of the people' 'Religion.' "
   Allan goes on to say "Karl Marx was hired by a mysterious group who called themselves
'The League of the Just Men' to write the Communist Manifesto as demagogic boob-bait to
appeal to the mob *end* In actualfact the Communist Manifesto was in circulation for many years
before  Marx'  name  was  widely  enough

scholars  of  this  subject  that  the  League  of  the  Just  Men  was  simply  an  extension  of  the

but Lucifer *end* Communism is just an anti-Christian atheistic force to destroy Christianity and
all  world  governments  by  modern  day  Luciferians  who  actually  control  world  commerce *end* Saith the Lord "For all nations have drunk of the wine of her fornication and the kings of the
earth  have  committed  fornication  with  her  and  the  MERCHANTS  OF  THE  EARTH  are
waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies *end* How much she hath glorified herself and
lived deliciously so much torment and sorrow give her for she saith in her heart I sit a queen

death and mourning and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire for strong is the
Lord God who iudgeth her *end* And the MERCHANTS OF THE EARTH shall weep and mourn
over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more." Revelation    *end*
   For the benefit of any skeptic or reader who has been brainwashed into believing that this
Luciferian  illuminati-Communist-Socialistic  Conspiracy  does  not  exist  today  let  us  look
into  a  warning  from  Winston  Churchill  that  he  wrote  February      in  the  Illustrated
Sunday Herald
   "From the days of SPARTICUS Adam Weishaupt to Karl Marx to those of Trotsky Bela-
Kuhn  Rose  Luxembourg  and  Emma  Goldman

IN  THE  TRAGEDY  OF  THE  FRENCH  REVOLUTION *end*  It  has  been  the  mainspring  of
EVERY  SUBVERSIVE  MOVEMENT  DURING  THE  TH  CENTURY;  and  now  at  last
this band of extraordinary personalities from the underworld of the great cities of Europe and

practically  the  undisputed  masters  of  that  enormous  empire."  Quoted  from  The  Missing

symbolized as the Dragon Revelation  *end* It is also symbolized as the Beast that Ascendeth

symbolic language that they are building a rainbow bridge between the personality man and

a nuclear freeze and disarmament *end* The countries of the world are to be pressured into giving
up these nuclear weapons and they are to be placed into the hands of the United Nations so

   "As a means in the hands of the United Nations to enforce the outer forms of peace and thus
give  time  for  teaching  on  peace  and  on  the  growth  of  goodwill  to  take  effect *end*  The  atomic

      Now let's  examine  the  two  other  partly  religious  and  partly  political  powers  Lucifer  is
predicted to use to bring this final struggle between Christ and Satan to its end *end* In Revelation
 we see again how this "First Beast" identifies with Daniel's prediction of the Papacy in
Daniel   *end* Daniel stated the "Little Horn" would speak "great words against the Most
High." And so did the Apostle John predict this and another unmistakable fact that clearly
shows us this "First Beast" is the Papacy "And there was given unto him a mouth speaking
great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue FORTY AND TWO
MONTHS."
   Here we see again this  years of Papal rule *end* As we have already examined  months
in Bible prophecy equals  years *end* Now in Revelation - we are shown a third partly
religious and partly political power emerging in history around the time the Papacy lost its
power  to  control  Europe *end*  We  are  sad  to  say  it  but  this  "Second  Beast"  here  in  Revelation
-  is  Protestant  America *end*  The  United  States  is  predicted  from  Scripture  to  be  first  a
lamb-like  nation;  however  later  it  is  to  speak  as  a  dragon  Revelation   *end*  Let  us  now
examine the  chapter of Revelation in more detail *end*
   Revelation the  chapter is divided into two parts *end* Verses  through  are a prophecy of
not only the Papacy but also the controlling powers of the known world in the ancient past
that promoted the various astrological religions that originally derived out of the Babylonian
worship of Nimrod Cush and Semiramis *end*
   If the reader will examine closely the "First Beast" of Revelation - and compare it
with  Daniel  -  he  will  see  how  similar  the  two  visions  are *end*  Daniel  -  is  the  same
prophecy  John  the  Apostle  was  given  almost    years  later *end*  Daniel  saw  these  pagan  Sun
worshipping nations in sequence while John saw the same prophecy in its full stage *end* Notice
in Revelation  this First Beast is made also from parts of the animals beasts we read of

as described in Daniel's vision *end* "And the beast which I saw was like unto a LEOPARD and
his  feet  were  as  the  feet  of  a  BEAR  and  his  mouth  as  the  mouth  of  a  LION  and  the
DRAGON  gave  him  HIS  POWER  AND  HIS  SEAT  AND  GREAT  AUTHORITk"
Revelation  *end*
   The Apostle John was not only given the same vision as Daniel but he was shown even
more prophetic truths *end* The Apostle John was shown Seven Heads among the Ten Horns and
"Another Beast" that Daniel wasn't shown *end* And John also saw that it is this First Beast that
the "Dragon Satan gave his power seat and great authority." And it is the Beast Papacy
about which the book of Revelation warns that will have a Mark and will have control of
commerce "that no man might buy or sell save he that had the mark or the name of the Beast
or the number  Rev *end*  of his name."
   However it is not this first beast that will cause the whole world to receive its "Mark" or its
name or its number  *end* It is this "Second Beast" Rev *end* - which is "another beast"
that Daniel the prophet didn't see in his vision that will actually "causeth the.earth and them
which dwell therein to worship the First Beast Papacy whose deadly wound was healed."
As we pointed out in history the Papacy's dictatorial rule was taken away by the French in
 *end*  And  in  Revelation    it  was  predicted  "And  I  saw  one  of  his  heads  as  it  were
wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wondered after the
beast." The Papacy's power is predicted from Scripture to be restored *end*
   "And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the Dragon Satan
Rev *end*   and out of the mouth of the Beast and out of the mouth of the False Prophet."
Revelation   *end*  These  three  Satanic  powers  are  also  symbolized  in  Revelation  as  three
beasts  political  powers  that  arise  from  three  different  areas  in  the  world *end*  They  are  The
Beast that ascendeth out of the Bottomless Pit Rev *end*  ; · The Beast that rises out of
the Sea Rev *end*  ; and · The Beast that comes out of the Earth Rev *end* - *end*
   These three unclean spirits are predicted to perform such deceiving miracles that most of the
inhabitants from the four corners of the world will believe this is the power of God *end* "For they
are the spirits of Devils working miracles which go forth unto the kings of the earth and the
whole world to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty" Revelation  *end*    As we pointed out earlier it will be Spiritualism that will unite the whole world under a
Luciferian Confederacy *end* And in our day Spiritualism will come in the name of The New Age
Movement Illuminati Catholicism and American Apostate Protestantism *end*
    Let  us  now  examine  by  Bible  prophecy  and  history  that  the  Dragon  and  the  Beast  of
Revelation  are symbolized here as the Illuminati and the Papacy; and let us see how it
is indeed American Protestantism who is the False Prophet *end*
   Like the Beast that ascendeth out of the Bottomless Pit Illuminati America was foretold to
emerge  around  the  time  the  Two  Witnesses  Old  and  New  Testament  were finishing their
testimony  at  the  end  of  the    years  of  Papal  rule *end*  And  like  the  illuminati  Protestant
America was born in the same year  *end* This will be understood by examining Revelation
the  chapter *end* Both the Papacy and Protestant America are foretold in Revelation - *end*    "And I stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven
heads  and  ten  horns  and  upon  his  horns  ten  crowns  and  upon  his  heads  the  name  of
blasphemy *end* And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard and his feet were as the feet of
a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him his power and his seat
and great authority *end* And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly
wound  was  healed  and  all  the  world  wondered  after  the  beast *end*  And  they  worshipped  the
dragon which gave power unto the beast and they worshipped the beast saying Who is like
unto the beast *end* who is able to make war with him *end* And there was given unto him a mouth
speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and
two months *end* And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God to blaspheme his name and
his tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven *end* And it was given unto him to make war with

the saints and to overcome them and power was given him over all kindreds and tongues
and nations *end* And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written
in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world *end* If any man have an ear
let  him  hear *end*  He  that  leadeth  into  captivity  shall  go  into  captivity  he  that  killeth  with  the
sword  must  be  killed  with  the  sword *end*  Here  is  the  patience  and  the  faith  of  the  saints."
Revelation - *end*
   Revelation - shows the world ruling political powers Satan has used and is using to
promote  Spiritualism *end*  Some  suggest  that  the  seven  heads  on  the  beast  of  Revelation
represent Egypt Babylon Persia Greece Pagan Rome Papal Rome and the seventh head is
the Papacy again when its religious dictatorship is restored *end*
   However most have forgotten about another kingdom that existed before Egypt became a
nation *end*  Shortly  after  the  flood  the  first  kingdom  Satan  used  to  promote  Spiritualism  was
Babel *end* And it was at Babel that Nimrod attempted to unite the world in that day into a One
World  Government *end*  Egypt  was  indeed  a  nation  that  promoted  Witchcraft  but  Egypt  was
never  a  World  Ruling  Power *end*  Babel  was  and  it  was  in  control  of  the  known  world  about
 years before King Nebuchadnezzar ruled the known world from Babylon *end* Babylon was
built on the ruins of Babel *end* So the seven heads found on the Beast of Revelation  could
also  be  Babel  Babylon  Persia  Greece  Pagan  Rome  Papal  Rome  and  the  Papacy  again
restored *end*
   Revelation - gives its reader a complete picture from the post flood era up until the
days  of  this  present  world  history *end*  From  Nimrod's  Tower  of  Babel  to  the  founding  of  the
United States history was laid out in  AD for the Apostle John to witness in vision *end*
   From the Tower of Babel and down through the centuries our Lord showed the political
powers Satan would use to spread the worship of himself through Spiritualism *end* His worship
by man started at Babel and is predicted in Scripture to be promoted from the Vatican under a
false  system  of  Christianity *end*  The  Papacy  will  be  in  the  near  future  the  head  of  this  New
World Religion that will unite with all Pagandom and Apostate Protestantism *end*
   Saith the Lord "And they worshipped the Dragon Devil which gave power unto the beast
Papacy and they worshipped the beast saying who is like unto the beast *end* Who is able to
make war with him?" Revelation  *end*
   During the  years of Papal Rule Satan used Catholicism to get the known world to bow
before him *end* However shortly before the Papacy was to receive its deadly wound Revelation
 the United States was to begin its mission in history *end* Here in Revelation - is the
prophecy that predicted the power of American Protestantism that would gradually become
the  Prophet  that  will  lead  all  the  world  again  to  accept  the  dictatorial  rule  of  the  Roman
Catholic Church *end*
   "And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb
and he spake as a dragon *end* And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him and
causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast whose deadly wound
was healed *end* And he doeth greet wonders so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on
the earth in the sight of men *end* And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of
those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on
the earth that they should make an image to the beast which had the wound by a sword and
did live *end* And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast that the image of the beast
should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should
be killed *end* And he causeth all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a
mark in their right hand or in their foreheads And that no man might buy or sell save he that
had the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name." Revelation - *end*
   While the Papacy was losing its power in the third quarter of the  century the United
States as an independent Protestant Nation began to make its appearance in history *end* It was to
emerge out of a wilderness symbolized in prophecy as Earth Rev *end*  *end* The United States

in  the  beginning  was  a  haven  for  those  Protestant  European  people  who  were  fortunate
enough to escape the brutal Papal Inquisitions *end* The United States was set up to have both civil
and religious freedom *end* However sadly enough the United States is predicted in Scripture to
throw away its civil and religious freedoms and "exerciseth all the power of the first beast
Papacy before him and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first
beast  Papacy  whose  deadly  wound  was  healed."  In  other  words  the  United  States  will
combine religious laws with politics as did the Papacy when it first ruled Europe *end* It will force
religious laws that actually derived out of Spiritualism which the Papacy adopted from the
Roman version of the religion of Astrology *end*
    The  United  States  is  predicted  in  Scripture  to  be  the  False  Prophet  that  will  herald  the
religious dictatorship of the Pope of Rome and cause the whole world to accept the Mark of
the Beast Papacy *end* Since we know now who this third power is found in Revelation
that shall go forth with the Dragon Illuminati and the Beast Papacy unto the whole world
to gather them together to battle of that great day of God Almighty let us now examine how
indeed  conspirators  have  been  working  within  the  United  States  government  behind  the
scenes within the high places of our government and other agencies to lead our country as it
is predicted *end*
    To  comprehend  how  degraded  our  government  is  becoming  we  need  to  see  what  the
conspiracy  of  the  Beast  that  ascendeth  out  of  the  Bottomless  Pit  Illuminati-Communistic-
Socialistic is working within our own country *end*
   As we examined earlier Adam Weishaupt founder of the Order of the Illuminati was a
witch and taught his followers the power of Witchcraft as a weapon to use against those who
would get in their way or tried to expose them *end* The whole order was trained to accomplish
their objectives in complete secrecy *end* Weishaupt himself even remained behind the scenes in
his  own  revolutionary  movement *end*  Only  his  top  members  knew  him *end*  Using  Witchcraft  to
brainwash  his  new  initiates  into  becoming  antiChristian  Weishaupt  recruited  indirectly  an
army of international terrorists and propagandists to win others to his movement and help in
his  struggle  to  overthrow  ALL  religions  and  ALL  governments *end*  He  even  had  schools  that
were specially designed to teach Internationalism *end* Only a select few were chosen to attend
these schools which were established in different parts of the world *end*
   Some of the training received in internationalism was the art of Subliminal Warfare *end* This
takes in mind control or mind sciences *end* As stated before Weishaupt in early Illuminism hired
an  army  of  writers  to  write  propaganda  literature  against  Papal  Christianity *end*  For  some
years before the French Revolution Weishaupt degraded the morals of the French people with
Atheism and with the licentious philosophies of Sodomy *end* And so do we see this same attack
on the minds of men here in the  Century *end*
   Back in the late 's maybe some of you who are old enough will remember the great
Communist plot that was uncovered in Hollywood where the FBI and the House Committee
on  Un-American  Activities  exposed  over    of  Hollywood's  top  stage  and  screen  stars  as
card carrying Communists *end*
    Myron  C *end*  Fagan  was  a  screen  writer  producer  and  director  both  in  Hollywood  and  on
Broadway *end* In  at the urgent request of John T *end* Flynn the author of The Roosevelt Myth
While  We  Slept  and  The  True  Story  of  Pearl  Harbor  Fagan  attended  a  meeting
in
Washington  DC  where  he  was  shown  a  set  of  microfilms  and  recordings  of  the  secret
meeting at Yalta attended only by Franklin Roosevelt Alger Hiss Harry Hopkins and Stalin
Molotov and Vishinsky when they hatched the plot to deliver the Balkans Eastern Europe
and Berlin to Stalin *end* As a result of that meeting Myron Fagan made open and avowed war on
this  Illuminati-Communistic-Socialistic  Conspiracy  and  formed  an  anti-Communist  society
called
to  expose  Communistic
propaganda in Hollywood radio and television in  there was set up in Washington DC
the Congressional hearings that unmasked some of the most famous stars in Hollywood as

the  Cinema  Educational  Guild *end*  As  a  result  of

the  work

card carrying Communists *end*
   You may wonder why these so-called stars are allowed to continue to influence the movie
screens  with
these  same
international bankers who own the movie companies *end* As we continue it will be shown that it
is these same international bankers who control Russia that are the same conspirators who
control  NBC  ABC  and  CBS  television  networks  and  many  large  newspapers  magazine
companies and the modern Order of the Illuminati *end*
    When  the  reader  understands  that  our  media  are  controlled  by  these  same  international
bankers maybe he can see why the Communist activity in Hollywood is alive and well *end*
   Man is by nature an imitator *end* Let an American stay in Britain for some time and when he
returns he may sound like an Englishman *end* Let there be a fashion change started and watch
how quickly folks will attempt to imitate *end* By studying the life of Jesus man learns what truth
is  personified *end*  Jesus  said  "I  am  the  way  the  truth  and  the  life  no  man  cometh  unto  the
father  but  by  me."  John   *end*  The  more  we  learn  about  Jesus  the  more  we  will  want  to
become like him *end* However the more our eyes take in the satanic influence of this world the
more a person can be transformed into its image *end*
   In the ancient world Satan degraded the morals of the people and led them to commit the
lowest  abominations  known  to  mankind  by  using  Nimrod  Semiramis and  Cush  who  were
worshipped as gods through various names and myths *end* Everything from cannibalism human
sacrifices incest sacred prostitution homosexuality murder rape self-mutilation torture and
suicide to magic sorcery spell-casting fortunetelling necromancy warlockery and so on
did the gods do in the epics of their lives *end* Therefore the ignorant pagans who worshipped
these false gods followed in their footsteps *end* Now in these modern times its the movie stars
rock stars and athletes who have become the gods that many worship *end*
   Do not our children or adults receive a steady diet of these same atrocities committed by
these stars in the roles they portray *end* Even the children's cartoons are saturated with crime and
violence *end* Are not the soap operas full of this junk *end* Awake *end* Awake *end* Can't the reader see the
subliminal  seduction  by  the  hidden  instigator  of  sin *end*  Can't  the  reader  see  that  there  is
definitely a reason behind all this crime and violence shown on TV in movie theaters and in
magazines and newspapers *end*
   Let's take a look again at the realm of music *end* Do we really need to ask where some of these
rock groups get their inspiration *end* Take for instance Kiss who paint their faces and leap on the
stage  puking  blood  declaring  "God  of  Rock  and  Roll  we'll  steal  your  virgin  soul."  The
producer  Bob  Ezrin  described  Kiss  as  "symbols  of  unfettered  evil  and  sensuality."  Rock
magazines call them "fire-breathing demons from Rock and Roll Hell"  *end*
   One of the members of Kiss Peter Criss boldly declares "I find myself evil *end* I believe in the
Devil as much as God *end* You can use either one to get things done." Another member of the
group has been quoted as saying "If God is hot stuff why is he afraid to have other gods
before Him *end* I've always wanted to be God"  *end*
    Another  Rock  group  we  should  take  a  look  at  who  have  been  a  great  influence  toward
Satanism is the Rolling Stones *end* Keith Richards' heroin arrest and his statement express what
they  stand  for  "There  are  black  magicians  who  think  we  are  acting  as  unknown  agents  of
Lucifer"  *end* Also the songs they have made such as the revolutionary propaganda of "Street
Fighting Man" and the anthem of satanist "Sympathy for the Devil" or "Dancing with Mr *end* D" the Devil bear out Richards' comment *end*
   The lead singer of Led Zeppelin openly admits to a fascination with black magic and the
guitarist  Jimmy  Page  owns  the  home  of  the  late  infamous  Aleister  Crowley  whom  we
studied earlier *end* Jimmy Page says he has his own occult bookshop because he explains "There
was not one good collection of books on the occult in London and I was tired of having to go
all different places to get the books I wanted"  *end* Page was asked if he were a practicing
witch and he answered with "I do not worship the Devil *end* But magic does intrigue me"  *end*

little  faith

the  French  had

in  Christ  by  writing  pamphlets

   The Bible warns that what we behold is what we will be changed into *end* King David in the
Psalm  said "Turn my eyes from beholding vanity; and quicken thou me in thy way."
Satan from the time of Adam and Eve used every device he could foster to take the eyes off
goodly  things  to  set  them  upon  the  evil  things *end*  Shortly  before  the  French  Revolution  the
Illuminati  destroyed  what
to
distribute  among  the  people *end*  Today  their  anti-Christian  attacks  are  a  hundred  times  more
subtle *end*  They  are  using  Hollywood  special  interest  groups  the  Feminist  Movement  Civil
Rights  groups  the  Federal  Reserve  Act  Congressmen  Senators  and  even  Presidents  to
degrade  and  divide  the  people  in  the  United  States  into  different  hate  factions  as  they  did
during the French Revolution to destroy that government and Christianity *end* They were known
as the Jacobin Clubs in the  century in France and today they are called Communists *end* Two weeks after the Kennedy assassination the late FBI Chief J *end* Edgar Hoover issued this
warning  "We  are  at  war  with  Communism  and  the  sooner  every  red-blooded  American
realizes this the safer we will be"  *end*
   The same poisonous propaganda that caused the French Revolution is steadily brainwashing
our youth as well as the adults today *end* Can any born-again Christian be so blind as to doubt
that the influences of Communism and the promotion of Witchcraft today are taking their toll
among Americans *end*
   Just as a sincere believer in Christ  receives  a born again  experience  spiritual awakening
--  "Therefore  if  any  man  be  in  Christ  he  is  a  new  creature  Old  things  are  passed  away;
behold all things become NEW." .Corinthians  -- so is there a counterfeit experience of
this found among witches *end* Just as a sinner experiences joy in his heart when he makes peace
with God through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ and is baptized and no longer wants to live a
life of sin so does a witch have a similar experience of relief when he accepts the belief found
in Witchcraft that Jesus is an imposter *end* In many covens before a witch can be initiated into
the arts of Witchcraft the initiate if not born into a family of witches must take a ceramic
cross  and  turn  it  upside  down  then  break  the  cross-bar  downwards *end*  This  is  to  show  other
witches that they have rejected Christianity and Jesus Christ *end* Today many ignorant people
who call themselves Christians hold this sign up to show that they are for peace when in
reality it shows they have rejected Jesus *end* The reason the name PEACE was tagged on this evil
sign is derived from the peace witches say they get after a new initiate shows his rejection of
Christianity and when he practices the arts of Witchcraft *end* This art of using gullible Christians
to promote Witchcraft propaganda is done through subliminal warfare *end*
   The Bible reveals to its reader what God is like *end* "But we all with open face BEHOLDING
as  in  a  glass  the  glory  of  the  Lord  ARE  CHANCED  INTO  THE  SAME  IMAGE  FROM
GLORY TO GLORY even as by the Spirit of the Lord." .Corinthians  *end* When the reader
studies  the  life  of  Jesus  Christ  from  the  Scriptures  the  Holy  Spirit  illuminates  his  inner
thoughts with an image that his own life will begin to imitate *end* God will mold little by little the
character of a wicked person into reflecting the righteousness of God which was seen in the
life of Jesus *end* By beholding Jesus we become changed into His image *end*
    It  was  in    that  America was  awakened  slightly  from  her  deep  sleep  to  see  what  the
Communists were up to *end* However America just opened her eyes a little then fell back into a
deeper sleep than before *end* Communists have their agents planted in every social and political
issue that is connected with the affairs of this country *end* Here quoted from the Congressional
Record for the year  on page  we read the warning
    "The  American  Communists  launched  a  furtive  attack  on  Hollywood  in    by  the
issuance of a directive calling for a concentration in Hollywood *end* The orders called for action

    Now  can  the  reader  understand  why  there  is  so  much  sex  crime  and  anti-Christian
propaganda constantly seen in the theater and on television *end* The average American citizen is
completely unaware of the Communist plot to program the American people into accepting
Socialism by degrading Christian principles and exalting Sodomy because all of the networks
of
these  same
conspirators  who  are  running  Communism *end*  To  see  that  these  things  are  so  let  us  now
examine the history of how Communism began to infiltrate the American society and how the
House of Rothschild connected American New York Bankers with the Illuminati *end*
   Now shortly before Karl Marx began to write theCommunist Manifesto another Illuminist
in America published a book that also outlined the plans of Adam Weishaupt *end* His name was
Clinton  Roosevelt  a  direct  ancestor  of  Franklin  D *end*  Roosevelt *end*  His  book  was  called  The
Science  of  Government  Founded  on  Natural  Law *end*  In  it  Roosevelt  had  some  of  the  same
philosophy  shown  in  Adam  Weishaupt's  writings  "that  the  men  of  the  Illuminati  are  to  be
regarded as the most perfect and enlightened of men"  *end* And in his book Roosevelt outlined
the  plans  of
the  regimentation  of  ALL  MANKIND *end*  In  other  words
enslavement of the vast populations of the world *end* To accomplish this the whole world was to
eventually be reduced to what we studied earlier during the French Revolution *end*
   Des Griffin quotes a statement made by Clinton Roosevelt about how Roosevelt felt about
our  Constitution   a  "leaky  vessel   which  was  hastily  put  together  when  we  left  the  British
flag"  *end* He also stated his atheistic and blasphemous feelings toward our Creator in his book
by  saying  "There  is  no  God  of  justice  to  order  things  aright  if  there  be  a  God  he  is  a
malicious and revengeful being who created us for misery."
    Clinton  Roosevelt  published  his  book  in   *end*  Before  this  Illuminati  propaganda  was
published to poison the minds of Americans another Illuminist played maybe even more of a
part in spreading poison to degrade the morals of the American people *end* This Illuminist was
sent to the United States from England like a Christian missionary is sent to a foreign land to
preach the Gospel of Christ *end* She arrived in New York in  and later in - held a
series of lectures among American Illuminists *end* Now remember the word Communist was not
used before by Illuminists to describe this movement until Karl Marx wrote the Communist
Manifesto in - *end* But here we will learn where the word Communist actually derived
from and what these Luciferians' real plans are for America *end*
   In Des Griffin's book Fourth Reich of the Rich he states the following
    "In    American  Illuminists  sponsored  a  series  of  lectures  in  New  York  by  English

the  Illuminati  for

of

this  new  undertaking."  Fourth  Reich  of

IIluminist  Frances  'Fanny'  Wright *end*  She  advocated  the  entire  Weishauptian  program  of  her
auxiliary
including  COMMUNISM  MADE  MORE
PALATABLE  BY  THE  LABEL  OF  'EQUAL  OPPORTUNITY  AND  EQUAL  RIGHTS
ATHEISM  EMANCIPATION  OF  WOMEN  AND  FREE  LOVE *end*  Those  present  were
informed that the Illuminati intended to UNITE THE NIHILIST AND ATHEIST GROUPS
WITH  ALL  OTHER  SUBVERSIVE  ORGANIZATIONS  INTO  AN  INTERNATIONAL
ORGANIZATION TO BE KNOWN AS COMMUNISM *end* This new destructive force was to
be used by the Illuminati to foment future WARS AND REVOLUTIONS *end* Clinton Roosevelt
a direct ancestor of FDR Charles Dana and Horace Greeley were appointed a committee to
raise
the  Rich  Griffin  Emissary
Publications  p *end*  *end*
   So you see the Communist movement as a tool to foment future wars and revolutions by
the  illuminati  was  actually  formed  here  in  the  United  States *end*  Frances  "Fanny"  Wright's
revolutionary aims for the United States could be seen in a tract she wrote called Views of
Society and Manners in America *end* The London Quarterly Review said of her book "A most
ridiculous and extravagant panegyric on the government and people of the U.S *end* accompanied
by the grossest and most detestable calumnies against the country"  *end*
   In the mid 's Albert Pike emerged to join this Luciferian Conspiracy *end* As we learned
earlier Albert Pike became the most recognized leader and author of Freemasonry *end*
   He was also the head of an order that promoted the exaltation of Lucifer who were called
the Palladists which most Christian Masons never knew about *end* In  Giuseppi Mazzini the
Italian  revolutionary  who  was  appointed  by  the  Illuminati  to  be  its  director  after  Adam
Weishaupt died appointed Albert Pike to head the operations of the Illuminati in the United
States  *end* Eventually Mazzini and Pike divided betweem them the work that was to be done
to carry on this One World Government Conspiracy planned earlier by Adam Weishaupt *end*
   Pike took control of the  THEOSOPHICAL SIDE of their operations while  Mazzini was  in
charge of the POLITICAL SIDE of the Order *end* To further their goals to destroy the Christian
religion and to promote a Luciferian One World Government Pike as the head of the Ancient
and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry organized another Order of Freemasonry called
the "new and reformed Palladian Rite." He named this after the Luciferian Order of which he
also  was  the  head  then  he  established  this  Order  of  Freemasonry  with  Three  Supreme
Councils  in  the  world *end*  They  were  in  Charleston  SC  Rome  Italy  and  the  third  in  Berlin
Germany *end*  The  promotion  of
these
Freemasons  by  instructions  issued  by  him  on  July      to    Supreme  Councils  of
Freemasonry in the world *end*
   Now in order that the reader may understand what Pike said to these  Supreme Councils
the  reader  must  remember  what  we  earlier  learned  about  in  the  modern  beliefs  found  in
Witchcraft *end*  Modern  day  witches  say   they  do  not  worship  Satan *end*  They  believe  Satan  and
Lucifer  are not the same god as Christians believe *end* Satan to modern day witches is just a
Christian invention to scare people into being good *end* However higher witches and Doctors of
Occultism believe Lucifer is really the  Good God while they say  it is Jesus Christ who is
the  Evil One *end* Des Griffin quotes Lady Queenborough's book Occult Theocrasy that records
Pikes own words "That which we must say to the crowd is "We worship a God but it is the
GOD one adores without superstition."
   "To you Sovereign Grand Instructors General we say this THAT YOU MAY REPEAT IT
TO THE BRETHREN OF THE nd st  degrees The Masonic religion should be by
all  of  us  initiates  of  the  high  degrees  maintainjed   in  the  purity  of   THE  LUCIFERIAN
DOCTRINE."  "IF  LUCIFER  WERE  NOT  GOD  WOULD  ADONAY  the  Christian  God
whose  deeds  prove  his  cruely  perfidy  and  hatred  of  man  barbarism   and  repulsion   for
science  would Adonay and his priests calumniate him?"
   "YES  LUCIFER  IS  GOD  AND  UNFORTUNATELY  ADONAY  IS  ALSO  GOD *end*  FOR

   Now can the reader see who is behind this Charles Manson Family and motorcycle gangs
some Rock groups Hollywood and Television high interest rates Feminist movements civil

hate factions akin to that of the French Revolution *end*  The  Bible  predicted  this  revolutionary
force as the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit *end* But we live in a time where we can
examine this movement inwardly because History says its been working behind the scenes to
bring these plans around since the French Revolution *end* We can trace their footprints in history
to show where they began and where they lead and who they are *end*
   To plainly state it all the footprints from Adam Weishaupt's time to our time will lead us to
the doors of a ring of international bankers who control the worlds wealth and have the same

nations pay *end* They also have the power to control the out-come of the war by simply cutting
off the flow of money they lend *end* So under the threat of war international bankers have used
their power to gain or increase control over governments *end* By keeping a nation in debt to them
they are in a position to demand a voice in the government affairs of that nation *end*
    However  another  goal  which  they  have  already  achieved  is  to  control  all  the  world's
Monetary Systems *end* Here we will learn how American bankers connected with the Rothschilds
and the History behind the Federal Reserve Trap *end*
    Gary  Allan  in  his  book  None  Dare  Call  It  Conspiracy  points  out  that  in  Karl  Marx
Communist Manifesto one of the planks written for world conquest was to get control of the
Monetary Systems *end* Gary says
   "Lenin later said that the establishment of a CENTRAL BANK WAS NINETY PERCENT
OF COMMUNIZING A COUNTRY *end* Such conspirators knew that you cannot take control of
a nation without military force unless that nation has a central bank through which you can
control its economy." None Dare Call It Conspiracy Allan Concord Press  pp *end*   *end*
   It was on May st  that Adam Weishaupt backed and led by the House of Rothschild
formed the International Revolutionary force called the Illuminati which later became known
as  Communism *end*  Now  the  revolutionary  slogan  for  the  Illuminati  in  Latin  was  "NOVUS
ORDO  SECLORIUM"  which  means  "A  NEW  ORDER  FOR  THE  AGES"  which  comes
from the philosophies of Astrology *end*
   As we saw earlier the insignia on the back of a dollar bill with the ALL-SEEING-EYE was
a Witchcraft sign found among the Masons which the illuminati was a part of shortly after the
Americans signed the Declaration of Independence on July   *end* Americans are made to
believe  that  the  Roman  numerals  MDCCLXXVI  on  the  pyramid  which  add  to    is  to
celebrate Independence Day of luly   *end* But reader nothing could be further from the
truth about this matter *end* This occult sign with its slogan "NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM" is to
commemorate the founding of the Illuminati on May st  not the fourth of July *end* And it
is not by chance that the EAGLE which was a symbol for Lucifer to the ancients and was
known as the Phoenix is now used as a symbol of the office of the President of the United
States  which  according  to  Bible  Prophecy  will  "SPEAK  AS  A  DRAGON."  Revelations
 *end*
   To show some more subliminal warfare of the devil by his people let us look at the number
 to see  its importance to these conspirators *end* The number   to witches is a most powerful
magical  number  in  practicing  warlockry *end*  As  established  earlier  Witch  covens  today  have
usually  members in number but do vary *end* When witches cast spells to injure people or cure
them  witches stand within the pentagon the center of the five pointed star and call on
spirit guides familar spirits Deut *end*  which are in reality demons and the witches control
them to do their bidding *end* The demon appears in the center of the Pentagram the five pointed
star *end*
   Reader now take a very close look on the back of your One Dollar Federal Reserve Note *end* Not only is the Phoenix EAGLE displayed here but look closely at the stars over the eagle's
head *end* Notice there are  stars *end* Look how they are arranged *end* It is not by chance that these
stars from the HEXAGRAM which by the way is the most EVIL SIGN IN WITCHCRAFT *end* Americans  are  made  to  believe  that  these    stars  represent  the    original  colonies   *end* However if the reader will again look closer into this great seal of the United States he will
discover that those who designed this seal did not display this magical number  by accident *end* Note the number of times  is used *end*
 *end* The Hexagram formed by  Pentagrams stars
 *end* The Eagle Breast Shield has  stripes *end*
 *end* There are  Berries on the olive branch in the eagle's right talon *end*
 *end* There are  arrows in the eagle's left talon *end*
 *end* There are  leaves on the olive branch *end*

   But for the record the reason again for the witchcraft signs found on the back of the One
Dollar  Federal  Reserve  Note  is  because  the  six  men  who  had  a  part  in  its  design  were
Benjamin Franklin John Adams Thomas Jefferson Francis Hopkinson also the designer of
the flag Charles Thomson and William Barton  *end*

Christianity *end* It may seem to be a contradiction to state that Communism and Catholicism and
Protestantism  will  unite  under  one  banner  after  stating  Communism  wants
to  destroy
Christianity *end* However Communism as stated before is not being run by Communists but by
the Luciferians who control the wealth of the world *end* They want to cause another "Reign of
Terror"  and
Protestantism are ALL just tools of the Devil which he is using to eventually destroy the Real
Religion of the Bible and attempt to make Lucifer the only god of this world *end*
    Using  Catholicism  Protestantism  and  Communism  the  Luciferians  hope  to  throw  the
world into complete mayhem so in the end the people of the world who survive this coming
Holocaust  will  become  disillusioned  with  both  Christianity  and  Communism  and  just  as
during  the  French  Revolution  blame  Christianity  and  Christ  as  the  reasons  for  the  world's

Satan's last effort to take complete control of this world *end* Jesus Himself predicted what will
happen in the last days we live
   "And woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days *end* But pray

   To continue to show how these three unclean spirits will gather the people of the world into
a great battle against its Real Creator let's now look at how Communism has penetrated into
Protestantism *end*  International  bankers  have  made  a  ton  of  money  financing  nations  to  buy
weapons to kill each other *end* Any concerned Christian who has any insight into Bible prophecy
can see that the Korean and Vietnam Wars like the World Wars were just a money making
venture  by  these  international  bankers  who  are  controlling  American  foreign  policy *end*  The
United States could have flattened the whole nation of North Vietnam without sending one
soldier to walk its territory *end* Without using the nuclear bomb the US Naval Fleet or the US Air
Force could have stopped the Communist aggression in Vietnam many years before it ended *end* One doesn't have to be a military officer to say that *end* But the fact is the military leaders were
under orders not to end the war *end* The long meaningless Vietnam war only accomplished three
things *end*  First  it  proved  to  be  a  bonanza  for  the  super-rich *end*  Second  it  destroyed  over
thousand  American  men  and  women *end*  And
Americans *end*
   What many Americans do not realize is that the Communists have been using Christianity to
spread  Communism  by  posing  as  missionaries  and  great  humanitarians  while  at  the  same
time overthrowing countries by riot and revolution *end* In the name of Peace they have destroyed
many *end*
   To put it bluntly the Communists have been working through Protestant organizations and
civil  rights  groups  to  spread  their  movement *end*  What  appeared  at  first  to  be  a  Protestant
Christian organization is now a political monster coming in the name of Christianity *end* It is one
of the biggest Communist traps next to the United Nations *end* And like the United Nations it too
had Communist elements behind its founding *end*
   We are pointing to the organization which calls itself The World Council of Churches and
its offshoot called The National Council of Churches *end* It was the World Council of Churches
that  helped  Vietnam  fall  completely  into  the  Communists'  hands  by  using  its  members  to
pressure the US into stopping its bombing of North Vietnam *end* Stormer goes on to state in his

Sheep and our Lord to a GOOD SHEPHEAD *end* David was a shepherd as a boy who protected
his sheep from the evil beasts around them *end* David just a boy killed a lion and a bear that took
a  lamb  out  of  his  flock *end*  See  .Samuel  - *end*  David  knew  as  the  shepherd  of  the  field

knowing his voice would follow so will the people of the Lord's Flock hear His voice from
the Scriptures and do the things which He commands us *end* One millennium before God became

   If the reader would like to study more into the deceptions with which Satan has fooled both
pagans  and  Christians  alike  may  we  recommend  you  get  yourself  a  copy  of  "Beware  It's
Coming - The Antichrist ." It proves through archaeology and history that Sun Worship
indeed began with Nimrod and that the Roman Catholic Church doctrines are from paganism
and not from the Bible *end* They prove this by a complete study of Catholicism using their own
publications *end* This book Beware It's Coming - The Antichrist  is one of the most complete
studies about the Antichrist and that mysterious number  that has ever been published *end* The

of worship." On the same page of this Encyclopedia we read the following "No regulations
for  its  observance  are  laid  down  in  the  new  testament  nor  indeed  is  its  observance  even
enjoined."
       As  we  studied  earlier  in  the  worship  of  the  Sun-God  every  thing  that  was  first  was
dedicated to the Sun-God and so was the first day of the week *end* This is Satan's counterfeit to

Papacy was to do against the Most High while John in the book of Revelation -

see more of this in a moment *end*

foretold about it except one of the four points of Daniel  "and think to change times and

       "Whatever  the  Mark  of  the  Beast  is  it  must  be  something  clear  and  definite *end*  God's
unmingled  wrath  would  not  be

true Sabbath *end* It follows that the seal or mark of this universal apostasy would be man's rest
day  or
the  Revelation *end*  Anderson   Pacific  Press

     As we have already observed too throughout this book that those who deal in Witchcraft
have always had their secret signs to let other occultist know who they are so does the Lord
of the Sabbath let His people know that they have the right God "And hallow my Sabbaths;
and they shall be a SIGN between me and you that ye may know that I am the Lord your

     Sunday is the MARK of the beast Papacy *end* The seventh day Sabbath is the SEAL of God *end* The mark of the beast and the seal of God are not a literal mark on the forehead as multitudes
have said *end* Lucifer is at war with Cod over the control of the mind of man *end* The Mark of the
Beast is applied when Sunday-Keepers by law force the observance of Sunday as a day of
rest *end* Today they are called BLUE LAWS *end* The Sabbath and the false Sabbath Sunday will
shortly bring the line of distinction between those who will settle in their minds which of the
two powers they will obey the Roman Catholic Church or the Christ of the Bible *end* Looking to
the end of the world Jesus said to those who will go through this Great Tribulation "But pray
ye that your flight be not in the winter neither on the Sabbath day." The end of the world has
not yet come *end* And Jesus tells us to pray that our flight to the wilderness during the coming
holocaust  be  not  in  the  winter  or  on  the  Sabbath  Day  showing  Jesus  stills  holds  man
responsible today for keeping the Sabbath Day holy *end*
     In Revelation - is Christ's last warning to the world *end* In it He is calling His people to
turn away from the Papacy and worship Him who created the Heaven Earth and the Sea and
the fountains of waters *end* When you observe the Sabbath Seventh Day as it is set forth in the
Ten Commandments you are showing that you recognize Jesus Christ as the Creator *end* When
you observe Sunday you  are showing you obedience  to  Rome *end*  It  was  Satan  who  used  the
Roman  Catholic  Church  to  change  and  tuck away  the  original  day  of  worship  to  Sunday
which  derived  out  of  Sun-worship *end*  And  "Know  ye  not  that  to  whom  ye  yield  yourselves
servants to obey his servants ye are to whom ye obey;" Romans  first part *end*
     In ancient times Kings would use a seal to authorize all their important documents *end* A seal
is a badge of authority *end* A seal not only shows the king's authority but also his territory and
his name *end* When a worshipper of Christ observes the Sabbath of the Bible he shows that he
recognizes Christ's authority His ownership of this world and that there is "none other name
under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved." Acts  *end*
       The  False  Sunday  Sabbath  will  be  the  tool  that  will  unite  the  merchants  and  the  labor
unions which are controlled by The Illuminati to join the Protestants in a joint effort to force
through legislation the observance of Sunday which will bring persecution on those who do
not recognize it *end*
     The God of the Bible is calling to Him a people who will follow Him all the way and will
help restore the Seventh Day Sabbath back to its rightful place *end* Even in the New Heaven and
New Earth God's true people will be observing the Seventh Day Sabbath *end* Isaiah the Prophet
foretold  this  in  Isaiah      "For  as  the  new  heavens  and  the  new  earth  which  I  will
make shall remain before me saith the Lord so shall your seed and your name remain *end* And it
shall come to pass that from one new moon to another and from one Sabbath to another shall
all flesh come to worship before me saith the Lord."
     The Lord of the Sabbath is calling His  people  who  have  been  deceived  by  the  Papacy
whether they are members of the Catholic Church or are Protestants who have been taught to
observe  Sunday  to  come  back  to  the  doctrines  of  the  Bible  and  come  out  of  Babylon  the
great which is a symbol of all churches that teach doctrines that derived out of Sunworship *end*
   The Bible makes very clear that the THREE UNCLEAN SPIRITS or the three powers that
go forth to gather the world against God will combine their forces under one banner *end* It will be
the Principle of Sunday legislation that will be the factor that will become the issue that they
will find common ground which will unite them under one banner *end* "These have one mind and
shall give their power and strength unto the Beast." Revelation  *end*
     Once a believer finds out about the Papacy's apostasy and how they have been duped into
believing in a system of false Christianity the Lord will demand his or her loyalty to Him *end* As
we showed from Scripture earlier our Lord accepts our worship even if we are in error if we
are  worshipping  him  with  knowledge  we  have  received *end*  But  when  our  ignorance  has  been
exposed  we  are  to  turn  from  error  and  darkness  to  Truth  and  Light *end*  Sunday  worship  is  a

the  wine  of

invention  of  Satan  himself  and  it  is  the  Mark  Sign  of  apostasy  while  the  Seventh  Day
Sabbath is a Seal Sign that we are the property of God *end* Won't you take your stand to restore
the ancient day of rest that recognizes Jesus as the Creator *end*
       During  the    years  of  the  Papal  apostasy  the  Scriptures  foretold  that  Babylon  the
Great  the  Mother  of  Harlots  would  move  its  seat  from  Babylon  to  eventually  end  up  in
Vatican City *end* However Babylon the Great is not only the Papacy it is all religions that teach
these same doctrines we have studied throughout this book *end* The Lord makes it very plain that
he has people still in Babylon and he is calling them out *end* This Great False Religious System is
also predicted from Scripture to be destroyed and those who do not take their stand to come
over to the Lord's side will also receive their reward *end* "And after these things I saw another
angel  come  down  from  heaven  having  great  power  and  the  earth  was  lightened  with  his
glory *end* And he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the great is fallen is fallen
and is become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every
unclean  and  hateful  bird *end*  For  all  nations  have  drunk  of
the  wrath  of  her
fornication and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants
of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies *end* And I heard another voice
from heaven saying Come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins and that
ye receive not of her plagues." Revelation - *end*
     The line that will show who are really on God's side and who are just pretending will be
clearly seen in those who make an all out effort to follow Jesus all the way *end* The Christian has
been duped by the Devil and conditioned by the Devil to observe Sunday as a day of rest *end* The
whole world schedules its activities either around Sunday or Friday the Moslem Sabbath
while the real day of worship the Seventh Day Sabbath has been neatly tucked away as a
whole *end* Revelation  which warns about receiving the Mark of the Beast in the same chapter
also goes on to show those who are not deceived and have recognized how to avoid being
deceived *end* "Here is the patience of the saints Here are they that keep the commandments of
God and the faith of Jesus." Revelation
     In another area of this last book of the Bible it clearly shows our Lord's True Church and
how  the  Dragon  Devil  has  made  open  avowed  war  on  her *end*  In  Revelation    we  read
"And the Dragon was wroth with the woman and went to make war with the remnant of her
seed which keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ." Reader
that's all TEN not just nine of them *end* "For whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend
in one point he is guilty of all *end* For he that said Do not commit adultery said also Do not
kill *end* Now if thou commit no adultery yet if thou kill thou art become a transgessor of the
law." James   *end*
     Once saved always saved is as false as Sunday worship *end* Jesus makes this very plain in
Matthew - "Not every one that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom
of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in Heaven *end* Many will say to me in
that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name *end* And in thy name have cast out
devils *end* And in thy name done many wonderful works *end* And then will I profess unto them I
never knew you Depart from me ye that work inquity."
     Even to people who call themselves Christians who can cast out devils speak in tongues
foretell  the  future  or  perform  healing  miracles  our  Lord  says  "To  the  law  and  to  the
testimony If they speak not according to this word it is because there is no light in them *end* He
that saith I know Him and keepeth not his commandments is a liar and the truth is not in
him *end*  He
law  even  his  prayer  shall  be
abomination." Isaiah  .John  Proverbs - *end*
       Even  though  the  reader  may  have  trampled  underfoot  the  Seventh  Day  Sabbath  which
recognizes Christ as creator our Lord is still holding back the winds of destruction so that
those  who  are  still  in  Babylon  may  have  a  chance  to  flee  out  of  it  before  it  receives  its
plagues *end* God promises a blessing on those who make their stand for Him in Isaiah - *end*

   Now to show the reader that there is no mistake in identifying this Beast where Satan's seat
is Revelation   who even boasts about changing God's Law "Here is Wisdom *end* Let
him that hath understanding count the number of the beast for it is the nmber of a man; and
his number is Six hundred threescore and six." Revelation  *end*
   The Beast here is the Papacy as we have already seen *end* Our Lord made it very plain that this
religious power will also be branded with Satan's number *end* Our Lord does not leave His people
in darkness about this *end* In Unfolding The Revelation by Roy Allan Anderson he has compiled
some very interesting facts that show how the Papacy is branded with this number of doom *end*
     Let us now see how the Papacy itself and the name of it's Pope today add to  *end* Here
found  on  page    of  Anderson's  Unfolding  The  Revelation  is  the  location  of  this  Beast's
residence *end*  Here  in  Greek  with  its  numerical  values  is  "HE  LATINE  BASILEIA"  which

     The name "LATIN" is derived from the earlier Romans centuries before the age of the
Papacy *end*  It  was  the  name  of  the  Sun-god  who  the  early  Romans  worshipped *end*  Hence  the
Romans  to  identify  themselves  with  their  Sun-god  adopted  their  god's  name *end*  They  called
themselves "LATINS."
     Here is a name that shows in what country this religious power has its church *end* Here again
in  Greek  with  its  transliterations  and  numerical  values  is  "ITALIKA  EKKLESIA"  which
means in Greek "ITALIAN CHURCH"  *end*

apostate Protestantism will make the Papacy the absolute authority in the near future *end* It may
appear  that  the  Papacy  is  at  odds  with  Communism  however  through  the  sure  word  of
prophecy they will unite *end* It may sound confusing to some but that's actually why the Divine
Language in Revelation  calls it Mystery Babylon the Great the Mother of Harlots and
Abominations  of
in
Revelation    means  the  great  spiritual  confusion  of  the  world *end*  Babylon  the  Great  is
pictured  in  Revelation    as  sitting  on  a  scarlet  red  color  Beast  that  ascends  from  the
Bottomless  Pit
movement
However it will be the Papacy that is to be the Head of this last Political Power again shortly
before the Second Coming of Jesus Christ *end*
   The Beast that ascendeth out of the Bottomless Pit has eight powers and we have already
seen  that  heads  on  a  Beast  in  Bible  prophecy  represents  the  controlling  powers *end*  It  is  still
unclear what powers for sure are the eight powers mentioned in Revelation - and it is
dangerous to be dogmatic when it comes to unfulfilled prophecy *end* However we can know for
sure who the first five are because they have already passsed in history *end* Says the Bible "And
there are seven kings FIVE ARE FALLEN and one is and the other is not yet come; and
when he cometh he must continue a short space *end* And the beast that was and is not even he is
the EIGHTH and is of the seven and goeth into perdition."
     The first five heads here suggests Babylon Persia Greece Pagan Rome and Papal Rome *end* It  is  the  sixth  and  seventh  head  where  most  who  have  studied  deep  into  the  Mystery  of
Godliness have still a problem solving because we have not reached in history as yet when the
Papacy  is  fully  restored *end*  However  we  can  be  positive  in  saying  that  the  eighth  power
represents the confederacy of Communism Apostate Protestantism and the Roman Catholic
Church *end*
     There are however some suggestions of who the sixth and seventh heads are *end* One Bible
Commentary suggests the following about the Eight Powers found on the Beast that ascendeth
out of the Bottomless Pit "According to this pattern of interpretation the powers represented
by the first five heads would be Babylon Persia Greece The Roman Empire and the Papacy *end* The Sixth and Seventh Heads might be Revolutionary France and the United States or the
United States and a restored Papacy." S.D.A *end* Bible Commentary Vol *end*  p *end*  *end*
     So the eight powers may be
     Babylon     Papacy
     Persia        Illuminati Communism
     Greece      United States Apostate Protestantism
     Rome        Papacy United States Communism
     Before we close there is another important issue of the day we need to seriously examine *end* Attorney  Constance  Cumbey  while
investigating  "The  New  Age  Movement"  exposed
another  goal  of  these  One  World  Luciferian  Government  conspirators *end*  They  will  call  for  a

interpretation of Revelation the  and  chapters however we do believe that there is a
wealth of valuable information for concerned Christians and non-Christians alike found in her
book that will help a seeker of truth avoid being another victim of this world-wide conspiracy *end*
We suggest the reader obtain a copy of The Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow by Constance
Cumbey *end*

Christendom about who this Second Beast is in Revelation - and how this Mark of the
Beast shall keep the true followers of Jesus of Nazareth from buying and selling *end* One of the

   We  are  very  much  aware  of

the  many  different

interpretations  given

throughout

most popular interpretations found in the 's on this subject tells us that this Second Beast
of Revelation - is not a political power U.S *end* but it is supposed to be a man who is a
Jew  from  the  tribe  of  Dan  and  a master  of  Satanic  magic *end*  He  will  proclaim  that  the  "First
Beast" which has been interpreted also as a man not a political power is the Antichrist and it
will be this "False Prophet" Second Beast Rev *end* - that will cause the whole world to
worship the First Beast man who is the Anti-christ because he will claim to be God  *end* This
"Second  Beast"  according  to  Hal  Linsey  is  the  "False  Prophet"  man  who  will  force  the
worship  of  this  "First  Beast"  man  who  will  be  a  Roman  dictator *end*  And  this  according  to
Lindsey is the Antichrist *end*
       Now  this  last  world  dictator  according  to  Mary  Stewart  Relfe  Ph.D *end*  will  control  the
world's buying and selling through the Universal Product Code that is found now on the back
of the items you buy at your favorite supermarket *end* Mary Steward Relfe states in her book The
New Money System  on page  what she thinks is the Mark of the Beast
     "The Mark of the Beast the only unpardonable sin specifically named in the Bible and the
only sin for which God metes out a named -fold punishment is
 *end* Receiving of one's own volition the Mark brand in the right hand or forehead; which I
believe will be a bar code facsimile incorporating a concealed use of '' unintelligible to the
eye which will entitle one to all the benefits of "Man's Great Society" in exchange for
 *end* Worship of the Beast Man who claims to be God; and
 *end* Worship of his image."
   This would sound very interesting to the casual seeker who would like to know what this
most  solemn  warning  really  means *end*  However  those  who  are  learned  in  the  areas  of  Bible
prophecy  and  have  studied  deep  into  Jewish  symbolism  know  that  what  Relfe  and  Linsey
stated  about  the  "Two  Beasts"  found  in  Revelation  the    chapter  as  being  two  men
breaks every law of good Biblical scholarship *end* A Beast in Bible prophecy is a symbol of a
"political power" not an individual man *end* Daniel the Prophet was clearly shown this Daniel
   *end* Like the names Baal and Eel multitudes also get the Number of the Beast
and the Mark of the Beast confused as being the same thing *end* They are NOT the same thing *end* There are five different warnings from our Lord concerning identifying with this Beast who

    *end* Or have the Name of the Beast
    *end* Or the Number of his Name
   The Mark of the Beast is not the Universal Product Code *end* It is a settling in your mind of
whom you will obey *end* The "First Beast" found in Revelation - is symbolized here as the
Papacy and all the pagan nations before it that promoted Spiritualism *end* The Mark of the Beast
is forced observance of the False Sabbath Sunday *end* The Roman Catholic Church is responsible
today in causing the majority of Protestant Churches to trample underfoot the original Day of
Rest Seventh Day Sabbath *end* Sunday worship is not a Commandment from the Bible but a
commandment found on the pages of most astrological heathen religions *end*
     It was Lucifer "The Shining One" whom the ignorant Sun worshippers bowed to and so is
it today *end* The Sun is just a camouflage the Devil hides behind to get the people of the world to
turn  their  backs  to  the  Real  Creator *end*  And  so  is  it  with  the  observance  of  Sunday *end*  Sunday
tradition  is  an  invention  of  Satan  himself *end*  Jesus  of  Nazareth  said  He  is  the  "Lord  of  the
Sabbath"  not  Sunday *end*  See  Mark     *end*  However  nobody  has  received  the  Mark  of  the
Beast as yet *end* The Universal forced Sunday observance law is still in the near future *end* There
shall  be  multitudes  of  Sunday  observers  who  died  in  Christ  in  Heaven *end*  The  controversy
between Sunday and the Seventh Day Sabbath is an issue that will be settled in these latter
times *end*  Just  before  Jesus  of  Nazareth  comes  for  his  people  all  the  doctrines  that  were  lost

during  the    year  Papal  apostasy  will  be  presented  before  those  who  call  themselves
Christians *end*  When  the  truth  about  the  Seventh  Day  Sabbath  is  brought  out  in  the  light
multitudes  of  sincere  Sunday  keepers  will  begin  to  ask  their religious  leaders  where  in  the
Word of God is the Commandment to observe Sunday *end* This will stir up a controversy in both
Christianity and in the Pagan Religions *end* While worldly Christians try to find excuses to ignore
the call for Sabbath reform a small group of sincere Christians from all faiths will hear what
the Spirit is saying unto the churches and will obey the call from God to
     "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy *end* Six days shalt thou labour and do all thy
work But the Seventh Day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God In it thou shalt not do any
work thou nor thy son nor thy daughter thy manservant nor thy maidservant nor thy cattle
nor thy stranger that is within thy gates For in six days the Lord made Heaven and Earth the
Sea  and  all  that  in  them  is  and  rested  the  Seventh  day  Wherefore  the  Lord  blessed  the
Sabbath day and hallowed it." Exodus -
     Sunday worship is part of the wine of her fornication False Doctrines that has made the
whole world intoxicated with false religions *end* Witchcraft Spiritualism the powerful force of
Lucifer's might will reach its peak shortly *end* The Father of Lies will pour out every conceivable
sign  and  lying  wonder  to  gather  the  ignorant  against  those  who  will  not  sanction  Sunday *end* "Babylon  the  Great"  of  Revelation  the    chapter  is  a  symbol  of  all  the  religions  of  the
world  united  together  under  a  New  World  Religion *end*  This  New  World  Religion  which  will
have both Roman Catholic and Protestant movements will unite with Spiritualism *end* This New
Age Movement calling for a New World Religion will also call for a Universal Day of Rest *end* This day will be Sunday *end* And it will soon be a criminal offense with the pain of death if not
sanctioned *end* It has been foretold and it will come to pass *end*
    We  should  not  ignore  however  what  Mary  Stewart  Relfe  Ph.D *end*  is  trying  to  show  her
readers *end*  The  Bible  clearly  states  that  the  true  followers  of  Jesus  of  Nazareth  will  suffer
persecution in these closing days *end* "And that no man might buy or sell save he that had the
Mark or the Name of the Beast or the Number of his Name."  Revelation  *end*
   Even though Mary Stewart Relfe Ph.D *end* has the Universal Product Code mixed up as being
the Mark of the Beast nevertheless the Bible makes it very plain that the followers of Jesus
of Nazareth will not be able to buy or sell either unless they accept the Number  of the
Beast *end* We should not ignore this universal plan to introduce a World Wide Credit Card or
Money Card with its International Code as being  *end* We thank Mary Stewart Relfe for her
efforts in trying to make sleeping Christians to become aware and behold what Satan is doing
today *end* Like Constance Cumbey's The Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow we recommend the
reader possess a copy of Mary Stewart Relfe's Book The New Money System *end*
     Whether or not World Commerce will be conducted by a cashless system for exchanging
goods by using a Universal Credit Card still remains to be seen *end* However the sad truth about
this  whole  Antichrist  movement  is  that  the  Bible  predicts  that  most  people  living  in  these
latter days will be deceived and lost by it *end*
       Why  will  multitudes  of  Christians  be  deceived *end*  Again  the  Scriptures  remind  us  "My
people are destroyed for lack of knowledge *end* Because thou hast rejected knowledge I will also
reject thee that thou shalt be no priest to me seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God I
will also forget thy children." Hosea  *end*
     We must know the issues for ourselves *end* We must have a firm knowledge and belief in
Jesus  Christ  and  His  Holy  Scriptures! *end*  The  religion  of  Astrology  is  predicting  a  Utopian
World Government will be established in the New Age of Aquarius *end* Lucifer and his people
are trying to condition the world to unite together so peace and safety will come *end* In the name
of Peace and Love does this great delusion go forth *end* However Paul the Apostle of Jesus of
Nazareth foretold "For when they shall say peace and Safety then sudden destruction cometh
upon them as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape *end* But ye brethren
are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief *end* Ye are all the children of

light We are not of the night nor of darkness." .Thessalonians - *end*
     There will never be peace in this present evil world until Satan His angels and his people
are destroyed by Jesus of Nazareth *end* Terrible will it be for those in this world who rejected the
Love of Jesus *end* Revelation  foretells how those who reject Jesus of Nazareth will feel at
his Second Coming *end* "And the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the
chief captains and the mighty men and every bondman and every free man hid themselves in
the dens and in the rocks of the mountains And said to the mountains and rocks Fall on us
and hide us from the face of Him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the Lord *end* For the great day of His wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?" Jesus will not set up
His kingdom in this present evil world *end* Jesus plainly states "My kingdom is not of this world
If  my  kingdom  were  of  this  world  then  would  my  servants  fight  that  I  should  not  be
delivered to the Jews But now is my kingdom not from hence." John  *end*
     It will be Lucifer himself personating Jesus that will deceive the very elect if possible into
believing that long looked for Kingdom of God has come upon the earth *end* Lucifer himself will
personate Jesus of Nazareth just before the real Christ comes with all His angels *end* This has
been foretold and it will come to pass *end*
     There is hardly a Christian Church today that hasn't already been deceived by the false
doctrine of a  year reign of Christ on earth *end* The  year reign of Christ is foretold in
Revelation - *end* Jesus of Nazareth will not meet His people on this earth *end* We are to meet
Him in the Air *end* .Thessalonians   *end* The  year reign is in Heaven not on earth *end*

yourselves lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkeness and
cares of this life and so that day come upon you unawares *end* For as a snare shall it come on all
them that dwell on the face of the whole earth *end* Watch ye therefore and pray always that ye
may  be  accounted  worthy  to  escape  all  these  things  that  shall  come  to  pass  and  to  stand
before the Son of Man." Luke   *end*
     "Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat they drank they bought they sold
they planted they builded; But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and
brimstone from Heaven and destroyed them all *end* Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son
of Man is revealed." Luke - *end*
     The cities of Sodom and Gomorrah were only a shadow in ancient times of how the whole
world was predicted from Scriptures to become *end* Our Lord is just as surely calling His people
out of the cities and heavily populated areas today as He called Lot and his family out *end* We
are to flee the cities! *end* We are to get out in the rural areas where a plot of land can be used to
grow our own food *end* The cities and heavily populated areas will be thrown into a world-wide
Reign of Terror *end* The cities will become blood baths *end* The Ark of safety for Christians is to buy
a piece of land as far away from the cities and heavily populated areas as possible *end* Those who
are like Lot's wife that cannot give up worldy pleasures will also fall victim as the heathen if
they do not listen *end*
     Our Lord's council for us today is found in the prophesies of Isaiah  - *end*
"Come my people enter thou into thy chambers and shut thy doors about thee Hide thyself
as it were for a little moment until the indignation be overpast *end* For behold the Lord cometh
out of His place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity The earth also shall
disclose her blood and shall no more cover her slain."
   We are living in the last era of the earth's history *end* It will end with Jesus' Second Coming *end* "And  to  you  who  are  troubled  rest  with  us  when  the  Lord  Jesus  shall  be  revealed  from
Heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God
and that obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ Who shall be punished with everlasting
destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power" .Thessalonians
- *end*

     "Seek ye the Lord while He may be found call ye upon Him while He is near Let the
wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts And let him return unto the
Lord and He will have mercy upon him; And to our God for He will abundantly pardon."
Isaiah   *end*

This book is dedicated to the two million Americans and counting who
have been programmed with Monarch-type trauma-based mind control *end*
This book is written to destroy trauma-based mind control before it
destroys the human race *end* It’s time for this horrendous secret to end *end* It is
also written as part of  God’s end time work to propel people of faith to the
high calling that is prophecied of the Body but cannot be attained without
men of faith understanding these things *end* Humanity’s great prophet said he
came to heal those whose hearts had been broken--literally split and
crushed and to free those who are captive *end* That work needs to go forward *end*

Blood sweat and tears are associated with this book *end* The blood of the
innocent victims of this mind-control cries out in a single unison along
with the pungent sweat of those who have tried to minister help to the
shattered humanity left by the sadistic programmers and the pools of tears
shed as this book was written "How long O Lord holy and true do you
not judge and avenge our blood on earth?"

Hope

... *end* Thou shalt know that I am Lord For they shall not be ashamed that
wait on Me *end* Shall the prey be taken from the mighty or the lawful captive
delivered *end* But thus saith Yahweh even the captives of the mighty shall be
taken away and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered for I will
contend with him that contendeth with thee and I will save thy children *end*

programming *end* This book tends to devote more emphasis to Illuminati
programming which is the highest level of programming *end* For individual
application in understanding a survivor of Monarch programming
therapists are admonished to use this material with consideration for the
Monarch victim’s personal case and situation *end* The authors disclaim any

Introduction by Fritz

There are many dangers to the human race some real and some imagined *end*
I believe that the trauma-based mind control which this book exposes is
the greatest danger to the human race *end* It gives evil men the power to carry

out any evil deed totally undetected *end* By the time the astute reader finishes
this book they will be as familiar with how to carry out trauma-based
mind-control as some of the programmers *end* Ancient and more recent secrets
will no longer be secrets *end*

Over the years I have spent thousands of hours studying the Illuminati the
Intelligence agencies of the world and the occult world in general *end* The
centerpiece of these organizations is the trauma-based mind control that
they carry out *end* Without the ability to carry out this sophisticated type of
mind-control using MPD drugs hypnosis and electronics and other
control methodologies these organizations would fail to keep their dark
evil deeds secret *end*

When one of the mind-control programmers of the Church of Scientology
who has left Scientology was asked about MPD he said "It’s the name of
the game of mind control." Research into this subject will never be
complete *end* This book has tried to give a comprehensive view of how the
programming is done *end* The basic techniques were developed in German
Scottish Italian and English Illuminati families and have been done for
centuries *end* Some report that some of the techniques go back to ancient
Egypt and ancient Babylon to the ancient mystery religions *end* The Nazis are
known to have studied ancient Egyptian texts in their mind control
research *end* The records and secrets of the generational Illuminati bloodlines
are very-well guarded secrets *end*

Even when I’ve learned about the location of secret depositories of some
of the Illuminati’s secrets in Europe America and Asia their records and
secrets are too well-guarded to be examined *end* The intelligence agencies
such as MI- began investigating these mind-control techniques early this
century but their records have been routinely destroyed and tampered
with *end* There are some survivors and professionals who know that the
British used programmed trauma-based MPD DID agents in W.W *end* I *end*

In Jan *end*  Richard Kluft submitted an article to the American Journal
of Clinical Hypnosis about  MPD patients who were between  and
years of age *end* Traugott Konstantin Oesterreich - who was
professor of philosophy at Tubingen University Germany studied MPD

and demonic possession and wrote a classic study of it in  entitled
Possession Demonical & Other which was translated into english in  *end*
His classic work on this subject provides documented cases which reveal
that the basic trauma-based mind-control was going on in Germany
France & Belgium long before the  century *end* Although he is unable to
put together all the pieces and the clues for what they are the reader of this
book might enjoy reading the  English translation of his classic work
after they finish this book *end* Oesterreich’s research in early s was the
type of research that the Nazi mind-control programmers were very aware
of *end* In  the Germans such as Oesterreich would describe personality
switches by the term "somnambuliform hypnotic states possession" or
"demonical somnambulism" or what might be called "Besessenheit von
Hypnotismus und bösen Geistern."

The ability to study both the spiritual & psychological aspects of mind-
control phenomena is often lacking today *end* There are exceptions such as
Dr *end* Loreda Fox’s book The Spiritual Dimensions of MPD *end* In the s
the Germans also were aware that the human mind has a variety of ego-
psycho-psysiological states rather than one unified mind which they
termed "Sub jecklose Psychologie" or the psychology of having correlated
psychological states rather than the concept of a single ego *end* The Germans
and Italians under the Nazi and Fascist governments began to do serious
scientific research into trauma-based mind control *end*

Under the auspices of the Kaiser Wilhelm Medical Institute in Berlin
Joseph Mengele conducted mind-control research on thousands of twins
and thousands of other hapless victims *end* Himmler supervised genetic
research *end* The Nazi research records were confiscated by the Allies and are
still classified *end*
A trip can be made from downtown Washington D.C *end* on a gray-
government van which serves as a shuttle to the Suitland Annex where the
government’s secrets are buried including research papers captured from
the Nazi Mind-Control research *end*

Most of Mengele’s concentration camp research is still classified *end* Much of
it dealt with mind control *end* A researcher can visit the top floor but

underground below the top floor are the real secrets *end* The real secrets are
lying in millions of sheets of classified documents hidden behind blast
proof doors *end* There they have vault after vault and row after row of top-
secret files that only a few privileged persons with security clearances
above COSMIC--such as with a "C" or "MJ" security clearance can visit *end*
Everyone with these high security clearances which I have identified is
connected to the Illuminati *end* Each underground area at Suitland Annex has
its own subset of secret access words known only to the initiated *end*

Most of the OSS records have been destroyed a few have been left the
important ones have been misfiled or remade *end* This is according to a
reliable British intelligent agent *end* Also according to reliable inside sources
the CIA is working night and day to remake old records to expunge all the
real dirty secrets from their records *end* The basement of CIA HQ is known as
"the Pit" In the Pit documents are being shredded and burned on a round
the clock basis *end* The large remains of these secrets are sold for landfill *end* The
Illuminati have developed secrecy to a fine art *end* They train their people in
the art of secrecy from the time they are born *end* Most everything they do is
done orally *end* They are trained not to write rituals and other things down *end*
There is very little paper trail left by the Illuminati *end*

The creation of slaves with photographic memories facilitates this secrecy *end*
But this book is not about how they have managed to keep their trauma-
based Monarch Mind-Control a secret *end* They have managed only to keep it
a secret to the general public *end* They have not been able to completely cover-
up the millions of wasted lives that their programming has ruined *end* For
many years they were able to shut-up and quietly discard their
programmed multiples by labelling them Paranoid Schizophrenics *end* But
therapists are now correctly identifying these people as programmed
multiples and are not only diagnosing them better but giving them better
treatment *end*

After Candy Jones’s husband deprogrammed her enough that she could
participate in writing a book exposing some of what had been done to her
the secret was out *end* See The Control of Candy Jones Hypnotism and the
CIA by Donald Bain *end* Ever since then the intelligence agencies and the
Illuminati have been carrying out damage control *end* Their biggest damage

control campaign has enlisted the power of Hollywood and the controlled
Media *end* This campaign is known as the False Memory Syndrome
campaign or as those of us who know the facts like to call it ""the false
memory spin-drome."

The headquarters of the False Memory Spin-drom Foundation is located at
 Market St *end* Suite  Philadelphia PA  *end* Some of the original
founders were doctors of the University of Pennslyvannia *end* The inside story
about these early FMS doctors of the University of Pennslyvannia is that
they practiced Satanic Rituals during their work days *end* What is unusual
about this--is that generally satanic rituals are performed at night but these
doctors did their coven work during the day *end* I know about these men *end* Now
you can see why these men started the FMS *end* They started it to cover their
own sins because many of them were abusers themselves *end* In other words
many of the EMS people are abusers of trauma-based mind-controlled
slaves or the victims of abuse who are in denial about their own abuse
from trauma-based mind-control *end* Martin T *end* Orn the person credited with
founding the FMS had ties to the CIA *end* Two members of the EMS
advisory board Ralph Underwager Ph.D *end* and theologian along with
Hollida Wakefield M.A *end* let the cat out of the bag when they publicly
supported pedophilia that is adults having sex with children *end* Their
support of pedophilia came in an interview with a Dutch magazine
Paidika The Journal of Paedophilia Winter  *end*

Although the False Memory Syndrome Foundation gets upset at any
mention that there might be a conspiracy by the perpetrators of mind-
control because conspiracies supposedly don’t and can’t happen they
want us to believe that all therapists are conspiring together to implant
false memories of abuse into their clients which could not be further from
the truth *end* Monarch slaves typically run into a great deal of denial by their
therapists that anything like this could be happening *end* The bottom line is
that Multiple Personality Disorder now refered to as Dissociative Identity
Disorder is a recognized bona fide diagnosis *end* False Memory Syndrome is
not a recognized medical or psychological diagnosis and does not appear
in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual III-R nor the recently released DSM-IV *end*

Those who followed Fritz’s writings have learned about the close working
relationship between the Mondavi’s and the Rothschilds see his article
about the Mondavi/Rothschild Napa Valley winery *end* Guess who got the
court precedence which gives the EMS some legal ground to attack
therapists *end* The precidence was supposedly a wife who went to a doctor
who told her she had syphilis *end* The wife assumes she got it from her
husband and divorces him *end* Then she learns she doesn’t have syphilis *end* The
husband then sues the doctor *end* Upon this bizarre case rests the legal
precedence for a third party to sue a person who gives advice such as
family members suing a therapist *end*

Upon this weak precidence an abusive father who worked for Monday in a
winery in California successfully destroyed a legitimate therapist who was
trying to save his daughter who was a programmed Monarch victim *end*
Supposedly the therapist had implanted false memories of rape in his
daughter when the record shows that the daughter’s mother told the
therapist the girl had been raped by the father *end*

When a valid case of SRA and repressed memories went to trial in
Washington state involving a police officer whose family was MPD Dr *end*
Richard Ofshe of the False Memory Spindrom showed up to cause
mischief *end* And mischief he did work *end* The case involved the children of a
""Christian"" police officer named Ingram who had satanically ritually
abused his family for years *end* The daughter won in court but Ofshe of the
EMS was not above writing a book full of lies and distortions about the
case *end* Lynn Crook who was the abused daughter in the case wrote up a
paper exposing what EMS person Richard Ofshe did to her The controlled
media is giving full license and great coverage to the EMS people *end*

Rather than fighting the government for scraps of declassified documents
which have had their secrets marked out and which may even be fake
documents manufactured by the CIA I have decided that there is a much
better approach to expose the Monarch Mind Control to the world *end* If a
person could never go to Nepal he can see pictures of it and believe it
exists *end* If a person can not get into the top secret records of the CIA and
Office of Naval Intelligence and MI they can be given the exact RECIPE
for creating a Monarch slave *end* I believe that by giving the step by step

recipe people will see that A *end* all the ingredients are available B *end* it is
possible to combine the ingredients C *end* all it takes is the motive to do it
and that motive is self-evident *end* We’ll even provide some of the names and
places as we go along *end*

This book will provide the step-by-step recipe for making a Monarch
Mind-Controlled slave It is a trauma-based mind control which programs
multiple personalities using every known technique of mind-control *end* Every
type of mind-control technique has been combined into a group package
which makes the total package almost impossible to break *end* It is this ability
to synthesize all these methods into a group package which is so powerful *end*

Edward Hunter author of Brainwashing In Red China testified in
before a U.S *end* Congressional House Committee on Un-American Activities

"Since man began he has tried to influence other men or
women to his way of thinking *end* There have always been these
forms of pressure to change attitudes *end* We discovered in the
past thirty years a technique to influence by clinical hospital
procedures the thinking processes of human beings *end*
Brainwashing is formed out of a set of different elements .. *end*
hunger fatigue tenseness threats violence and in more
intense cases...drugs and hypnotism *end* No one of these elements
alone can be regarded as brain washing any more than an
apple can be called apple pie *end* Other ingredients have to be
added and a cooking process gone through *end* So it is with
brainwashing..."

Hunter said brainwashing was a Red Chinese threat *end* He said that the
chinese were the ones using these tactics *end* In reality this mind control was
being done in the U.S *end* and Hunter was a pawn to help justify the criminal
activities of the programmers should they ever be found out behind their
cover of "National security."

The handlers of mind-controlled slaves carry around a black or grey  ring
notebook or a lap top computer with the access codes and triggers *end* Some
of the programmers and handlers have this all memorized *end* The deepest

parts core/gems/executive committee false trinity etc *end* are charted in
esoteric language such as Enochian Hebrew which is considered
magical and Druid symbols *end* I have never gotten the opportunity to look
at one of these although a number of the slaves who I’ve talked with have
while they were being programmed *end* These notebooks have color-coded
graphs showing the arrangement of alters the structure of the system the
training of the alters the history of the alters and other details *end* All the
primary tortures carried out on a slave are coded using dates/no.s so that
the memories can be pulled up by the programmers *end* There is a standard set
of hand signals gestures and codes that allow a handler to work with
someone else’s slave but the accepted code among the handlers is to leave
another man’s slave alone *end* As one leading psychiatrist put it "Different
ideologies use the same methodologies of mind control."

The Illuminati have secretly put in base programming that allows them
ultimate control over many of the other groups’ slaves *end* This will be
described within this book *end*
For both the ease of reading and the ease of writing I have dispensed with
most footnotes *end* To provide my sources would double the size of the book
and many of them are confidential *end* In the past when I have attempted
crediting information some people have gotten bruised feelings for having
been passed over or for being named *end* When information comes in from
several sources it becomes difficult to pass out credit *end* I have made
conservative judgement calls about what material I could use *end*

Most of this information has been verified by several reliable sources *end*
Confidential eyewitnesses are often the only source when there is such a
powerful conspiracy to keep this vast NWO mind control secret *end* Paper
trails were not left or are not available *end* Programmed slaves who have
worked for the military as mind-controlled slaves have witnessed their
files expunged and sanitized *end* The New World Order in  made training
films for their novice programmers *end* Monarch slave Cathy O’Brien was
used to make both the film "How to Divide a Personality" and "How To
Create a Sex Slave." Two Huntsville porn photographers were used to help
NASA and the NWO create these training films *end* Undoubtedly other porn
training films exist too *end* In others words there is film evidence of the

Monarch Total Mind-control but these porn films are kept in very secure
sites *end*

During the last few years I have visited with ex-programmers I have
visited with hundreds of victims of the Monarch type programming *end* I have
gone to programming sites I have visited with therapists who work with
the victims of this mind-control and I have met several of the
programmers of the CIA/Illuminati face to face in the adventures of trying
to save people from their programming *end*

I hope that God gives me the strength and the opportunity to get the
information I have learned out to the world in general *end* When this
information gets out hopefully it will help lift some of the secrecy of the
Monarch Programming *end* The Monarch Programming is a foundation rock
of the New World Order that when pulled up will reveal the most evil two-
legged bugs and slimy critters *end* When their rock is lifted they will have to
scurry to hide *end* Because the authors know what the programmers do they
must honestly record several areas of programming that will be
controversial *end* The programmers are very much into demonology *end* Before
therapists close their minds to this subject the authors would like to point
out that they personally know of cases where Monarch slaves whose
Christian personalities & other alters didn’t believe in demonology were
talked into participating in real deliverance and the slaves discovered
much to their surprise that work they had unsuccessfully tried to do for
years with their therapist was accomplished in a day or two *end*

Some prestigious researchers have decided the subconscious doesn’t exist
because they can’t find it--its mysterious *end* To the man in the street the
concept "subconscious" is as mysterious as the concept "demon" *end* Both
have been the objects of intense research by U.S./Brit./Ger *end* Intelligence
groups *end* In fact many of the concepts in this book have been purposely
obscurred by the Illuminati’s control over the media and universities *end*
These obscurred concepts include M.P.D *end* DID recovered memories
hypnosis demonic possession aliens mind-control the subconscious a
conspiracy to bring in a NWO truth etc *end* The smokescreens of controversy
will continue; but those who love the truth if they seek it will realize the
importance of this book *end*

It’s on public record that MK ULTRA the mind control research which
CIA director Admiral Stansfield Turner admitted to in  spent millions
of dollars studing Voodoo witchcraft and psychics *end* On August   at
a Senate hearing the then CIA director Admiral Stansfield Turner
disclosed that the CIA had been conducting mind control on countless
numbers of unsuspecting victims for years without their knowledge or
consent *end* These CIA mind-control operations were carried out with the
participation of a least  scientists and at least  American institutions
including prisons pharmaceutical companies hospitals and  medical
colleges & universities *end* Many of America’s most prestigious institutes of
medical research had cooperated with the CIA *end* as well as numerous big
name corporations *end* Casey admitted that day that the CIA did mind-control
consisting of drugs hypnosis & electro-shock *end* A few of the victims of the
Monarch Project were even awarded financial compensation for their
misery *end*

But what was admitted was admitted in the spirit of covering up the extent
of the full truth *end* The compensation was actually hush money because
victims were given "gag orders" by judges not to talk about what had
happened to them *end* It’s been a disaster for Monarch victims that so many
ministers have ignored those words of their Scripture "For we are not
ignorant of the devil’s devices."  COR  This book is a must for those
ministers who seriously believe "Having therefore these promises dearly
beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit
perfecting holiness in the fear of God."  COR  *end* In  TIM  -
believers who "nameth the name of Christ" are asked to purge themselves
of their uncleanliness  unclean spirits *end*

There are many top notch Christians in the churches today who are under
mind-control incl *end* many of the Christian leadership *end* I would like to
remind Christian ministers that Isaiah the great prophet said "The Lord
GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned that I should know how to
speak a word in season to him that is weary he wakeneth morning by
morning; he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned." Ignorance is not
godliness *end* Isaiah learned to speak with the great learned men of his day
just as Paul the great apostle could speak to the learned men of his time *end*
One of the character traits of God is that He is all-knowing *end* WHO says it is

godly to be ignorant *end* The prophet Daniel said Yahweh God "reveals the
deep and secret things." Dan *end* a God’s instruments will do this
revealing *end* Jesus’ advice to his disciples was in effect to "Be wise as
serpents and gentle as a lamb" *end* This advice certainly applies in helping the
victims of trauma-based mind-control *end* Paul in his letter to the
Thessalonians  Thes  says that in effect that different people need
different counseling but they all need to be treated with patience *end*

The first step in suggesting a cure is to find out what happened *end* That is
what this book is about *end* This book is about how the Occult Network
creates the problem that therapists and a few ministers try to deal with *end* But
the keys to open doors to healthy solutions for the victims of trauma-based
total mind control will reveal themselves in this book for the reader as this
book reveals the nitty-gritty of how the total mind-control happens *end* Christ
came to free the captives Isaiah  *end* Satanic ritual abuse has a history
that is almost as old as history itself *end* Good King Hezekiah was a victim as
a child of SRA *end*  Chr *end*  who got free *end* Moses confronted the satanic
magic of Pharoah’s magicians who could create live snakes from sticks *end*
The Apostle Paul had to deal with Simon Magus a leader of what is now
known as Satanism *end* Solomon one of the greatest men of faith backslide
and became one of the greatest satanists of all history *end* We have "no
fellowship with unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them" as
per EPH  *end*

While we have no fellowship with evil the mind-control programmers are
counting on us being so ignorant of their devices that they can hide their
control devices behind perversion & filth that many people shy away from *end*
We must be strong enough to face evil and not shy away from it *end* The
victims of mind-control must look evil in the face & not look away to gain

 Glossary of How Basic Terms are Used In This Book

For those readers who are not familiar with these basic terms let us
introduce you to the definitions under which this book uses them *end*
Alter-Our usage is trying to follow the programmers usage of this word *end* A
dissociated part of the mind which has a seperate identity and is given cue
codes by the mind-control programmers to trigger that dissociated part of
the mind to come to the front of the mind *end* The alter’s identity may be a
gem rock a tape recorder a poodle a white kitten a dove a horse or
even think of itself as a person or a demon *end* It all depends on its
programming *end* An alter is different from an alter fragment in that the alter
fragment is a dissociated part of the mind which serves only a single
purpose *end* The programmers will give an alter a history and insure that
shadow alters will provide a full range of accessible emotions *end* Sometimes
the distinctions between alters and alter fragments is vague but examples
from the two ends of the spectrum are easy to tell apart *end* We use the word
alter in this book to conform to what the programmers’ charts are encoding
as alters *end* A typical main Mengele-created grid would be a grid of x
principal A-coded alters which is  principle alter personalities *end* In
Illuminati systems ceremonial "alters will consist of  alters placed on a
spinning pedistal together into triad goddesses or gods *end* That means that an
A-coded alter on some levels is actually  alters spinning together which
must be locked in place to communicate with and then rotated to
communicate to the other two *end*
Beta--This is the second Greek letter and it represents the sexual models
and sexual alters that the Programmers are creating *end* The primitive part of
the brain is involved in this type of programming *end* An early sexual abuse
event will be used to anchor this programming *end* These sexual slaves will
develop sexual abilities that are far beyond what the public is aware is

even possible *end* They also receive the worst kind of abuse far beyond what
most people’s imagination can picture *end* Beta alters generally see
themselves as cats *end*
Councils llluminati--The Illuminati has frequent meetings *end* Some of
these meetings are organized to appear "acephalous" and "accidential" in
their meetings when in reality they are structured and planned *end* One group
MJ- has gone by the following names the Group the Special Study
Group the Wise Men the Operations Coordinating Board OCB
Committee  Committee  Committee PI- Committee and Policy
Planning Group PCG *end* Some of the formal policy and ritual groups have
names that all Illuminati members who have gotten high enough to learn
will recognize

The Council of  Council of  Council of  Council of  The Grand
Druid Council The Committee of  and the Committee of  known
as Fortune  *end* Many of the meetings are conclaves without formal
names *end* The Grand Druid Council is not something fictional but an actual
body of people who formally meet and whose membership we have been
trying to keep track of *end* The groups which make decisions to control this
planet are networked together *end* Each decision has its own origin and route
that it takes *end*
Delta--This is a Greek letter shaped like a triangle which symbolizes
change in calculus *end* It has become a favorite word to use in naming things
for the occult elite *end* Delta teams are  person assassination teams which
usually are secret teams *end* Delta Forces is an elite unit that operates under
the Joint chiefs of staff that is made up of highly trained total mind-
controlled slaves *end* Delta models are slaves whose sole purpose is
assassination *end* Delta alters are alters within an Illuminati alter system which
are programmed to be assassins *end* These alters are often some of the deepest
in a system and in a Genie bottle or with Umbrella programming *end*
Deliverance ministry-This book is about HOW the mind-control is done
it is not a textbook on solutions *end* The use of the term deliverance ministry
in this book connotates any persons who via faith in God is able to pray
for divine help in a fashion that a victim is helped from demonic activity *end*

A deliverance ministry is a natural outgrowth of a life in harmony and
fellowship with Yahweh God *end* However this is not to be confused with
Exorcism of the traditional Catholic or witchcraft nature in which certain
spells and incantations are used in a prescribed method *end* "Deliverance"
connotates divinely inspired faith exorcism involves ritual *end* A deliverance
ministry might perhaps teach a person about forgiveness or how they can
renounce an oath or how to apply Jesus Christ’s atoning blood to their life *end*
In this fashion the person finds deliverance through biblical spiritual
principles rather than the efficacy of some ritual or hocus pocus spell *end* This
book is in no way meant as a blanket endorsement of every spiritual
warfare tactic *end* If anything this book suggests that ministers learn more
about mind-control as well as grow stronger in their walk with Almighty
God *end*
Illuminati--The Illuminati are  elite bloodlines which have manuevered
themselves into control over this planet *end* They lead double lives one for
society and a hidden one which is based on a gnostic luciferian philosophy
which consists of lots of blood rituals *end*
Monarch Programming--This was a specific Project carried out by secret
elements of the U.S *end* government and intelligence groups *end* There were
according to someone a few years ago who had access to the computers
which contains all the names of active monitored human slaves
actively monitored Monarch slaves *end* However this book uses the term
generically to include all victims who have suffered this type of trauma-
based mind-control *end* In the same way that a brand name like "Hyster" is
used to describe all lifts--when we use the term we use it in its broadest
sense *end* This is the only way it can be used and technically correct because
as of this date the authors have not seen who is on the active Monarch
Program list of slaves *end*
System-- This term is used in several ways *end* It is frequently used to refer to
a victim of total mind control because the victim consists of alters
programming implants internal computers and numerous dissociative
states which function together as a system *end* The word is also used in this
book to refer to the body’s functional physiological units such as the
respiratory system *end* The word is also infrequently used to denote the

established social-economic-political system controlling the world also
known insiders as the Network *end* Other standard meaning may also
occasionally be used for the word *end*
Multiple Personality/Multiple personalities or MPD
Dissociative Identity Disorder or DID
is the situation where different dissociative parts of a single brain view
themselves as separate persons *end* The DSM-IIIR definition of MPD is the
guideline for determining MPD for this book *end*
New World Order-- The New World Order is the global design for a One-
World-Government One-World-Dictator and its constituents *end* Insiders call
themselves the "network" and "the neighborhood" *end*
Satanic Ritual Abuse SRA--This is used to represent all categories of
ritual abuse which would be inspired by the desire to rob kill or destroy
something worthwhile in a person especially their freedom of thought *end*
Many groups carrying out SRA do not mention Satan by that name *end* They
may make Pacts to Baphomet and call upon Rex Mundi or Belair or
Lucifer or the Father of Light God or Kali or even "Jesus" or "Jesus
Christ" there are demons which call themselves "Jesus" who are not to be
confused with Yeshua or Yehoshua ben Joseph who is known as Jesus
Christ of Nazareth *end* SRA is not a value judgement by the authors against
some group the victims themselves on some level know that he or she is
being abused *end*
Switching--This is when one part fragment of the mind takes over from
another or in simple terms this is when one alter personality or alter
fragment takes the body from the alter which is holding the body *end*
Switching can occur via the Programmers’ codes for calling up alters or
by external or internal stimuli that trigger an alter to come out *end* Switching
will usually cause at least a flicker of the eyes and for outside observers
who know the different personalities they will observe another personality
take the body *end*

The Selection and Preparation of The Victim

A - Selection Based on Genetics and Disassociative Abilities

B - Availability

C - Mental and Physical Features

One of the primary reasons that the Monarch mind-control programming
was named Monarch programming was because of the Monarch butterfly *end*
The Monarch butterfly learns where it was born its roots and it passes
this knowledge via genetics on to its offspring from generation to
generation *end* This was one of the key animals that tipped scientists off that
knowledge can be passed genetically *end*

The Monarch program is based upon Illuminati and Nazi goals to create a
Master race in part through genetics *end* If knowledge can be passed
genetically which it is then it is important that parents be found that can
pass the correct knowledge onto those victims selected for the Monarch
mind-control *end*

The primary important factor for the trauma-based mind-control is the
ability to disassociate *end* It was discovered that this ability is passed
genetically from generation to generation *end* American Indian tribes who
had traumatic ritual dances and who would wait motionless for hours when
hunting children of Fakirs in India who would sleep on a bed of nails or
walk on hot coals children of Yogis those skilled in Yoga who would
have total control over their body in trance Tibetan buddhists children of
Vodoun Bizango and other groups have a good ability to disassociate *end*

The children of multigenerational abuse are also good at dissociation *end* The
Illuminati families and European occultists went to India and Tibet to
study occultism and eastern philosophy *end* These Europeans learned yoga
tantric yoga meditations and trances and other methods to disassociate *end*

These skills are passed on to their children via genetics *end* A test is run when
the children are about  months old to determine if they can dissociate
enough to be selected for programming or not *end*

Mind-controlled slaves are created for different purposes hierarchy or non-
hierarchy purposes *end* The Illuminati create mind-controlled slaves who are
to function within the Illuminati hierarchy *end* These slaves will usually have
their genealogies hidden and will be created to have excellent cover lives
to insure that they are not detected *end* They will be given multifunctional
programming and will usually be used to help program other slaves *end* The
abuse will not be as physically visible as it will be on the bodies of slaves
who are not born to be part of the Illuminati elite *end*

Members of Moriah’s Moriah = the Illuminati Luciferian elite will have
undergone as much trauma as other slaves however the torture scars and
the control are better concealed *end* These children will often receive lavish
experiences as well as talks to convince them that they are part of the elite *end*
By the way body scars will show up better under black light that is the
same black light as used in clubs *end*

The Illuminati and other organizations have also programmed individuals
who are simply expendable *end* These are sex slaves who are used up and
killed very early in life one-time use saboteurs breeders soldiers drug
couriers and so forth *end* The bodies of these people will often show visible
torture scars *end* The expendable are the children of parents who were
blackmailed into turning their children over to the CIA *end* This is all hidden
by the power of the National Security Act *end* These are children who have
been sold by pedophile fathers or pornographic parents *end* The programmers/
masters program them with the expectation that they will be "thrown from
the freedom train" when they get to age  *end* Freedom Train is the code
word for the Monarch trauma-based mind-control *end* To be thrown from the
Freedom Train means to be killed *end*

The CIA and the Illuminati are skilled at blackmailing parents to give up
their children *end* They would watch the mail for porn *end* Pedophile and
murderers who abuse their children are warned that they will go to prison
for long lengths of time if they do not cooperate by selling their children

into mind-controlled slavery *end* In return for the parent’s cooperation they
provide rich financial rewards to the parents *end* It’s clearly a case of "if you
don’t cooperate you lose in life big time if you do cooperate you win big
time."

Ministers are often set up with Betas a sexual model who then blackmail
them *end* The ministers do not want to lose their status and profession via
scandals so they agree to turn their children over when young to the CIA
to work with *end* The Illuminati like to blackmail these ministers when they
are finished with their Seminary schooling and committed to the ministry
at about  years of age *end* The idea of having nothing to fall back on after
they have committed their entire life to one profession is too much for
these weak willed men and they buckle under the threats *end* If they don’t
buckle under the resulting consequences will remove them from ministry *end*

The type of father who is most preferred by the Programmers to offer up
their children for programming is the pedophile *end* If a father will abuse his
own little baby girl then the Programmers know that the man has no
conscience *end* This father’s involvement in criminal activity and thereby his
vulnerability can be continually increased *end* They want men who they
believe will not develop any qualms later on in life about what they have
done *end* A man who waits until his daughter is a teenager to molest her is
usually esteemed to have too much conscience for the programmers *end*

A big distinction must be made between hierarchy Monarch slaves and
non-hierarchy Monarch slaves *end* The reason there is such a big distinction is
that they are not programmed the same way *end* Since this book is giving the
recipe for how to create a Monarch slave we will have to cover the
distinction between slaves within the Illuminati and those slaves who
function outside of the Illuminati hierarchy *end* It is important to stress that the
label "Monarch" is used in this book in a generic sense for the modern
trauma-based total mind-control that is taking place *end* Whether an Illuminati
mind-controlled slave is technically in the Monarch records or out of the
actual Monarch Program data files kept on computer is merely a
technicality *end*

In my Fritz’s other writings I explain about how the Illuminati created

the CIA *end* I know that some of its directors were members of the Illuminati
and I strongly suspect that the other CIA directors were probably full-
fledged members too *end* The two organizations need each other *end* If the CIA
didn’t have the international backing of the movers and shakers of the
world it would have been exposed and done away with *end* Likewise the
Illuminati because it is so secret needs organizations through which it can
work *end* The CIA is a front for the Illuminati and the CIA in turn sets up
fronts *end*

Some of those fronts are elaborate well-staffed well-equipped
programming sites such as many of the state mental hospitals McGill
Psychiatric Training Network consisting of  Montreal hospitals esp *end* St *end*
Mary’s NASA in Huntsville AL; the Presideo CA; and NOTS at China
Lake CA to name a few *end* For a more complete list see Appendix B *end* The
Illuminati couldn’t do it alone without its fronts *end*

Satanists within the Network & the CIA took over Boy’s TownNE in the
early s & used that famous orphanage for a constant supply of boys
for programming *end* Boy’s Town is perhaps the most famous but there are
whole long list of others *end*

When the Monarch Programming started the top men were Illuminati *end*
Originally Joseph Mengele was the lead programmer *end* He had already
achieved the rank of Grand Master later Ipssimus within the Illuminati *end*
He had become skilled in music in Kabbalistic Magic in dancing in
abortions and in torture by the way Mengele had a sadistic mother and
programming children *end* Many of the concentration camp children that
Mengele programmed still survive and still love him to this day as
"Daddy" *end*

Mengele disappeared from Auschwitz in Jan *end*  several months before
the final chaos began in the Third Reich *end* He disappeared so the Illuminati
could smuggle him to the U.S *end* so that his exceptional knowledge of
programming--honed and fined tuned on thousands of concentration camp
child victims could be put to use on a grande scale in the U.S *end* He travelled
worldwide but especially in western U.S *end* doing his programming
accompanied by his pair of two black servants *end*

American Monarch survivors remember his spotless German uniform his
shiny boots which he wore during programming his thick German accent
his handsome features his cleft chin the space in his front teeth the way
he would jab with his thumb while programming as if he were still saying
"links rechts" to lines of jews coming into the concentration camps *end*

The reason Mengele was so excited to do the selection process of inmates
coming into Auschwitz was that he was choosing inmates for his numerous
mind-control trauma experiments *end* He was especially anxious to get
identical twins because his genetic research related to mind control needed
persons of identical genetic makeup *end*

Traditionally the Illuminati had been having their children inspected by a
woman with the rank of Grande Mother *end* She would determine the fitness
of the children and then present them for a formal acceptance ceremony at
age  to the Grande Druid Council *end* This procedure didn't change when
Mengele came over--the programming just jumped from being an occult
science to one that had full access to the Medical Psychiatric Judicial
Scientific and Governmental sectors via the power of the National Security
Act and the Intelligence agencies *end*

The Illuminati's programming of multiples prior to Mengele's arrival were
simplistic compared to the sophisticated techniques engineered by the
Nazi Germans whose Mind Control research included some non-German
nationals such as some Italians *end*

Just as a victim who is killed by an  century musket is just as much
victimized as someone killed by an M- so a victim of the pre-
programming was just as victimized as those programmed with more
sophisticated techniques *end* For the Illuminati the child's programming is
planned by the Circle another name for their organization before it is
born *end*

From the Illuminati's perspective their plans involve generational spirits
and positions within the hierarchy *end* The child is conceived according to
their rituals and the steps that that child will go through follows a well-
thought out detailed regimen for programming it *end* In contrast the children

from foster homes or pedophiles do not receive the same regimen *end*

Hierarchy slaves will in turn be used to program and train other hierarchy
children while CIA slaves and Mafia slaves and KKK slaves etc *end* will be
discarded *end* This is why a Presidential Model is "thrown from the Freedom
Train the name of the Monarch Program in the Underworld" *end* Women
and men in the Illuminati will continue to help with the programming their
entire lives *end*

The Illuminati is programming such vast numbers of children they need
everyone of their able members to help *end* Moriah's total membership
worldwide numbers in the millions *end* The Illuminati regimen for their
children is far more controlling than the CIA's programming *end* Not everyone
in the Illuminati gets their mind-split and becomes a programmed multiple *end*
However everyone does get some type of mind-control *end*

Those who have been spared multiplicity still must participate in a two-
week intense mind-control session that might be compared to the Army's
Ranger school *end* Those who participate in this have learned obedience *end*
Those who haven't learned obedience are forced into ritual gladiator type
duels or other punishments to eliminate them *end*

Finally a traitor’s death as pictured on one of the Tarot cards is waiting *end*
Sharon Tate was left hanging in the No *end*  Tarot Card’s "hangman
position" from the house rafters *end*

The best therapists will quietly admit that traditional therapy is inadequate *end*
Unless God intervenes people who are born into the Illuminati don’t
escape it while alive *end* This book isn’t a mere exercise of academic thinking
but is written with the assurance that freedom is possible there are viable
answers *end*

Some children live in foster homes or with adopted parents or in
orphanages or with caretakers and guardians *end* Because these children are at
the mercy of the non-related adults these types of children frequently are
sold to become mind-controlled slaves of the intelligence agencies *end*

In review remember that because many of these organizations are
controlled by the Illuminati; an Illuminati slave may often work for one of
these front groups while the Illuminati maintain control over the base-
program *end* The intelligence networks were started by and run by the
Illuminati *end* They are Illuminati fronts *end*

The use of slaves crosses many organizational boundaries within the
overall Network *end* If a slave is to be used as a Delta model assassination
they may be selected for strength and dexterity *end* The Delta Force is the
army’s elite unit made up of Monarch slaves *end*

If they are to operate as a Beta model sexual slave they will be chosen if
they can master technique *end* Occassionaly they might in some circumstances
be selected for how pretty the programmers expect the child to become *end*
Some parents have produced good looking children and are actually
sought-after to bear children to sell into the Mind Controlled Slavery
"Freedom Train" System *end* However vastly more important for Beta Sex
Slaves are their ability to be programmed to have charm seductive skills
charisma and creativity *end* Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and the
programmers can put almost any kind of body to use as a sex slave *end*

Almost any sex slave can fit somewhere into the script of the Illuminati/
New World Order/crime syndicate "porn" movies *end* I place porn in
quotation marks--because what they call porn doesn’t resemble what the
public thinks of porn--we’re not talking Playboy type porn we’re talking
ghastly horrible atrocities that are as sick as anything done in the Nazi
concentration camps *end* For instance it takes little acting ability or beauty to
have one’s head chopped off while having sex *end*

There are different types of sexual slaves but the Illuminati wants to get
Beta alters which are sharp talented skilled and resourceful *end* They will
use these Beta alters such as the Black Widow alters for espionage and
blackmail *end*

To make sure that the child’s mind develops properly the baby will be
interacted with so that those areas of the brain that are important to
develop will develop to the maximum *end* It is a well-known fact that areas of

the brain grow according to how much stimulation and use that area of the
brain receives *end* For this reason Grande Dames who are involved in
programming will spend time drawing and showing faces to the child and
seeing if the child can recognize identical faces *end* Almost any other item
will be used candy canes with stripes match the candycanes with the
same no *end* of stripes trees or pencils *end* The child must learn to match
identical items very early--even before they can speak *end* This is so they will
be able to build mirror images into their mind *end*

 Contents  Next

All the senses are trained for building the mirror images; for instance such
as silks and cottons can be used for the sense of touch *end* The child will have
to match textures *end* The Programmer the Grande Dame and Grande
Mothers will teach the child to have good abilities in copying reflecting
repeating echoing or re-echoing and mirroring *end* They will be taught for
hours how to re-echo something verbatim *end* Some of these teaching methods
are almost like games.For instance  pins will be in a box and the small
child is given a short time to decide how many pins are in the box *end*

A certain level of intelligence and creativity is needed for time to be
wasted on programming *end* You can not program a mind which is weak *end*
Most of the people programmed are very intelligent *end* One study of
multiples said that multiples were  or above in . *end* and then mistakenly
blamed their multiplicity on their . *end* Attempts to program people with
low intelligence or no creativity were discovered to be a waste of time *end*
Methods are used to greatly enhance the victim’s intelligence and
creativity *end* The Illuminati will also work on enhancing their psychic
abilities such as telepathy and cliarvoyance *end*

The head programmers have their own little mottos about building solid
structures which they like to express to new trainees *end* These include "An
unstructured house mind of the slave is like unto a house without walls"
"A house undisciplined is like unto a house without walls it will crumble
within itself’ and "A house divided against itself will not stand."

Much of the structuring will be discussed in chapter  but the structuring
begins at birth for the victim so this chapter will discuss the first steps *end*

In order to build a solid good house one needs to have a solid foundation *end*
In order to build a solid foundation one needs to know how the land lays
and what the weaknesses of the land are--if it is sand or rock or clay etc *end*
One needs to design one’s house to take advantage of the natural lay of the
land *end* Will storms come from this or that direction *end* Where will the house
need extra protection *end* The very same principles pertain to programming--
because a structure is being built *end*

Many evil geniuses within the Illuminati added their contributions to the

Monarch programming *end* One of the most important was John Gittinger of
Oklahoma because he was the genius who could understand how a little
child’s mind was when it was in infancy *end* In order to work with something
you must know what you are working with *end*

John Gittinger who is no longer alive worked at programming for years *end*
His contribution was in the mental assessment area *end* John Gittinger b *end*
 was the director of psychological services at the state hospital in
Norman Oklahoma *end* He got a master’s degree at age  and joined the
CIA’s MK Ultra Mind Control in  *end* He was a high school guidance
counselor and a Navy lieutenant commander during W.W.II *end* In the late
s he moved back to Oklahoma *end* He was heavy set and goateed *end* Its
been said he looked like the actor Walter Slezak *end* He had an insatiable
curiosity about understanding human personality *end*
When the Illuminati looked around for men skilled in personality
assessment to assist the Monarch Programming John W *end* Gittinger was
one of their men who they selected *end* Gittinger was not the only researcher
into personality that the CIA hired but he was their top man in terms of
the programming of children *end* From the end of W.W *end* II until he began with
the CIA in  Gittinger was studying how to assess personality *end* At the
Oklahoma State Hospital he had large numbers of adults who could be
studied *end*

After Gittinger started doing personality assessment for the CIA *end* most of
his work became highly classified *end* The Rolling Stone article of July
 asked why years of research into personality assessment should be so
secret *end* In fact it was so secret that Gittinger was not allowed to talk to
journalists even though it was public knowledge that Gittinger did
personality assessment work/research *end* The reason that such an apparently
benign science was kept secret is that it plays a major part in the success of
the Monarch Programming *end*

John Gittinger designed the PAS Personality Assessment System *end* This is
an extraordinary method to evaluate human behavior and predict their
future behavior *end* As far as we know most of the PAS is still classified
SECRET *end* The PAS is based on the ability to differentiate different types of

people *end*

There are  major differentiations or dimensions *end* They are called the E-I
dimension the R-F dimension and the A-U dimension *end* People are born
with their original placement within each of these three spectrums *end* In other
words there are  axes that can be graphed to describe a baby’s
personality *end* The baby might be graphed-- I Internalizer F Flexible and
A Role Adaptive *end*

If the baby were graphed this way i.e *end* I-F-A then the Programmers
would automatically know this child’s mind will become a social or
religious reformer *end* The child’s programming charts would then be labelled
some suitable occupation such as "Environmental Activist" "Pentecostal
church reformer" "Consumer Advocate" or "Activist against Narcotics" *end*

The programming for that child then would follow  month goals to
develop that mind-controlled slave into one of the best in that occupation *end*
In fact one of the co-authors of this book Fritz is indeed I-F-A *end* which
helps explain why he is trying to reform society and religion with this
book *end* While it took Fritz many years to find his correct nitch in life
programmed multiples are steered in the correct direction very early in life
with all the breaks and all the money needed from the Network to open
opportunities *end*

There are three possibilities for the child in regards to his original
personality components *end* He can express the component or suppress or
repress it *end* As the child goes through life he has two periods within which
he can change suppress or repress his behavior/personality *end* In the PAS
the first period is called "compensation" and the second is called
"modification" *end* The amount of punishment for a personality trait and
pressure to change from others will determine the amount of change which
the child’s mind will perform on its original personality *end* The activity level
of a person at each point in their life is also measured *end* The intensity of
each of the scores is also rated *end*

The actual PAS system is far more detailed than the example above but it
serves to give a simplified idea of how it works *end* The essential dynamics of

an entire personality can be written in a short code which might be written
for example E-uc Fcu + A+u+uH+ *end* However even that code is
shortened E-uc can be written simply i’ *end* The basic  dimensions to
personality provide  basic types *end* However the PAS allows for  basic
positions in each of these  basic types which yields  discrete basic
types *end*

Next the person can change their predisposed primitive personality
initially  different ways and this then gives ³ or  different
types *end* The second change can be done on  types of modification which
makes for  types *end* Then the programmers can factor in activity
level their "Normal" level intelligence base age sex and education and
life experiences *end* In other words what appears to be simple has a high
degree of calibration to it *end*

The person who was best with the PAS was its brainchild Gottinger
himself *end* His intuition along with his PAS system gave him an uncanny
idea of how a person'smind works now and how it would work in the
future *end* He sadistically reveled in putting his skill to use programming
children *end*
The actual assessment codes that have appeared on programming
assessment charts which the Monarch child assessment teams have used to
evaluate describe & assess a child to be programmed follow the standard
symbols created for PAS *end* Some about Gittinger’s work has escaped the
secrecy of the intelligence agencies *end* Concerning the Gittinger Personality
Assessment System see "An Introduction to the Personality Assessment
System" by John Winne and John Gittinger Journal of Community
Psychology Monograph Supplement No *end*  *end* Rutland Vermont Clinical
Psychology Publishing Co *end* Inc *end*  *end* See also the Rolling Stone
magazine article July   "The CIA Won’t Go public" *end* Because so
little is known about the PAS test it needs to be explained some *end*
Observations in relation to the Wechsler Intelligence Test provided the
initial ideas behind the PAS *end* The digit-span subtest of the Wechsler
Intelligence Test which rates the ability to remember numbers forms the
basic test used for the E-I dimension *end* What Gittinger discovered was that

short order cooks had good number-memory which = Internalizer
personality or "I" *end* A high digit span in any person tells much about them *end*
People who don’t separate themselves well from their environment are
Externalizers = E *end* The "I" personality was a good baby *end* The "E" type who
prefers doing to thinking is a "too-curious" baby who will make demands *end*
I’s would often be pressured to become more outgoing and E’s are often
pressured by parents to be more self-sufficient and to progress from
crawling which they like to learn to walk *end*

Pure Internalizers become more withdrawn after several drinks and
uncompensated E's are more likely to become sloppy drunks garrulous *end*
Based on the E-I dimension predictions can also be made for how LSD
will affect a person *end* This is the E-I dimension *end* The block design subtest
shows whether a person is a Regulated R or a Flexible F person *end* This is
the R-F dimension *end* The regulated person had no trouble learning by rote
but didn’t understand what he learned *end* The Flexible person on the other
hand had to understand something before he learned it *end* R children could
learn to play the piano easily but the great concert piano players were F
children who had persevered to master what they considered drudgery *end*

The third dimension is the Role Adaptive A or a Role Uniform U
person *end* A could be defined as Charisma while people tend to ignore the U *end*
The CIA has  patterns that a skilled observer looks for and these then
are related to the PAS and Wechsler subtests *end*

Illuminati Mothers-of-Darkness alters trained in observation chart what
they see a child do *end* A child’s behavior with certain toys certain hand
responses and certain social responses can be observed and used to assess
how this child would score on the PAS test *end* EEG Electroencephalogram
patterns co-relate to the PAS digit-span test *end* This allowed them to use the
EEG patterns to overcome cultural bias in the test *end* It also gave the
Monarch programmers the perfect tool to assess small children before they
have verbal skills *end*

David R *end* Saunders at the Univ *end* of Col *end* working with the CIA *end* wrote a
paper in  showing the connection between alpha waves and digit span *end*
In  Mundy-Castle wrote about the connections between EEG

printouts and Wechsler-Bellevue Test variables *end* Here is the tip of the
iceberg that EEGs were being used to determine pre-verbal personality in
children *end* And Salvatore et al wrote at the Massachusetts Mental Health
Center Boston Mass clear back in  about the "predictive potential of
Gittinger’s theory" in an unpublished research paper *end* The Massachusetts
Mental Health Center was an early participant in all this *end*

The child’s guardians must teach the small victim obedience *end* They must
teach the child to keep its eyes open and to hold still *end* These skills are
important because the child will be subjected to the EEGs in vast
amounts *end* The hospital equipment would be something like an -channel
Grass EEG machine where  electrodes are placed on the child’s head
and brain wave patterns are printed out charting such things as
background variability discharges background suppressions sharp
waves etc *end*

The electrodes will have designations such as T T etc *end* In special
programming sites a machine with electrodes will be hooked up to the
child’s head for repeated tests *end* The newer machines accomodate up to
/ diameter pads electrodes which are attached with electrode adhesive
tape or small needled ends to the child’s scalp *end* The child’s hair will be
parted in an area and the electrodes will be hooked to the skull *end* The
attendant will tell the child "Don’t move *end* Keep your eyes open *end* Look at
this point *end* Don’t blink *end* Don’t move your body." Then this procedure will
be repeated for  minutes to an hour *end*

Eventually hundreds of readout from electrodes clipped to the skull of the
child will chart the brain waves of the child *end* From these brain waves the
programmers can determine what type of personality the child has *end* This
personality assessment criteria and ability is one of the guarded secrets of
the programming *end* Should unexpected behavior crop up the slave may be
hauled in for more EEGs *end* The PAS tests would reveal to Gittinger what a
person’s weaknesses were *end* The PAS shows what a person wants *end* And
these are called the soft spots of a person’s personality *end* Also the PAS
shows mental weaknesses on where a person will be instable and can be
broken down *end*

Certain types of stresses will have a cumulative effect of hurting a person *end*
A stress-producing campaign is run against CIA targets and by doing this
they can neutralize a potential enemy *end* This information collected from
children who are potential victims for the Monarch programming is
essential for knowing how to structure that child’s programming *end* For
instance IFU children often are autistic IRU are schizophrenic children
and IR or IF are fantasy prone *end* It will be further explained shortly how this
aids programming *end*

An Internalizer personality would be important deep inside an alter system
while an Externalizer would be useful for a front personality *end* Internalizers
are predisposed to the production of mental fantasy *end* By knowing what the
child was the programmers know what they already have and what they
must add or build into the thinking of the alters they will create *end*

Likewise some alters need to be R and some F *end* And some need to be A
and some U *end* Regulated R personalities like to have narrow limitations on
their activity *end* This makes them suitable for programming *end* The R’s readily
accept authority and will not try to step out of the range of their habits *end*
The R has a marked ability to learn without understanding *end* They easily
learn material by rote because they do not need to understand it before
they will learn it *end* This is another asset they have that the programmers like *end*

The programmers may or may not want an A Role Adaptive personality *end*
A future country singer needs charisma -- a future computer programmer
doesn’t *end* Without being able to finely determine what is there the
programming could not be fine tuned *end* If the child is good in math it will
have its programming scripts steered in that direction *end* If it has artistic
brainwaves then the programmer will use art work in programming *end*

The art work of the european artist M.C *end* Escher is exceptionally well
suited for programming purposes *end* For instance in his  drawing
"Another World" the rear plane in the center serves as a wall in relation to
the horizon a floor in connection with the view through the top opening
and a ceiling in regards to the view up towards the starry sky *end* Reversals
mirror images illusion and many other qualities appear in Escher’s art
work which make all  or more of his major works excellent for

programming *end* The use of these kinds of elements will explained later *end*

Five children each given the same Alice In Wonderland script will each
use the script differently during programming *end* The programmer takes the
child’s own creativity and works with that unique creativity *end* The child
must create the images itself if the programming is to hold *end* It won’t work
if the images are someone else’s *end* The child organizes its internal world to
suit his/her own experiences such as castles boxes rooms and dollhouses *end*
The PAS type testing will continue during the early years of the slave’s life
to make sure the programming has not driven the child crazy or psycho *end*
The child will move down the script decided for it for its whole life based
on these early tests *end* More about how this works later *end*

The EEG tests run frequently on children to be programmed also show
brain tumors and medical problems beside just the brain wave patterns *end*
The PAS tests can show how easy a person can be hypnotized *end* If the
testing by the EEG’s doesn’t reveal a child who can be easily hypnotized
they will be rejected for programming even though modern drugs and
extreme torture in some cases will be applied to "salvage" children they
really think they need to program but are clearly not easily hypnotizable *end*
EEG’s can also be used to see what state of consciousness the brain is in *end*
The Monarch Programming is based on structuring MPD alter systems
which is covered in Chapter  *end*

The success of this structuring its excellent finetuning comes from the
initial testing which means programs are properly built on whatever
foundation the mind has *end* The CIA front Human Ecology Society tested the
PAS *end* In  the CIA moved Gittinger’s base of operations to another
CIA front on Connecticut Ave *end* Washington D.C *end* called Psychological
Assessment Associates *end*

Because Gittinger believed genetic-based differences exist in people
which is one of the bases for the Monarch Programming his work was not
accepted by main stream psychology *end* In  Gottinger described the
PAS system "...the Personality Assessment System PAS a indicates
the kinds of internal and external cues to which the individual is most
likely to respond; b suggests the types of stimuli that are most likely to

produce behavioral change; c provides an understanding of the inter-
intra- and impersonal environments in which a person is most likely to
function efficiently; and d offers insight into what constitutes stress and
predicts probable behavioral response to such stress including
maladjustments should they occur *end*

"In the area of experience the PAS offers a method for
obtaining specific clues to personality structure and
functioning *end* Thus the PAS a allows for direct inferences
concerning an individual’s primary response style b
suggests the quality of the compensations and modifications
he has achieved in response to social and environmental
pressures; c provides an understanding of personality
development in terms of the interaction of primary structure
environmental pressures and adaptive tendencies; d offers a
procedure for evaluating the surface or contact personality
developed over time; and c makes possible the assessment of
the fundamental discrepancies between the surface personality
and the underlying personality structure--discrepancies that
typically produce tension conflict and anxiety." Winne John

Wow *end* Gottinger’s description of PAS is specifically the needs & goals that
the programmers had when they initiate programming the personality splits
in tiny -month old children *end* People associated with the following listed
organizations may assist the Network to use their child for trauma-based
programming *end* Children from families where one or both parents belong to
the following organizations are often routinely sent off in early childhood
for trauma-based mind control *end*

We are now in rd and  generations of people who are programmed
multiples *end* And even into deeper generations in some Illuminati
bloodlines *end* What can’t be covered here is the enormous secret drama
involved in Moriah finding and implementing control over parents via
prescribed or illegal drugs fear blackmail etc *end* so that they will assist them

in getting the children programmed *end*

If the motherly instinct is too strong the mom may be prescribed
tranquilizers so that there is a stable house for the child’s front alters to
grow up in *end* Unreliable non-multiple fathers are "debriefed" by Ilium
multiples who debrief & then erase their memories of what is happening to
their children *end* Parents may have only a limited view *end*

If the Illuminati’s preferred plan is followed it has  beginning
foundational stages to prepare the victim for programming *end* Let’s list these
and then afterwards explain in detail these first  stages *end* One programmer

named the stages   as stages    but the In utero preparations and
preliminary ceremonies actually form an initial first stage *end* The first stage
is the initial ceremonies & the In Utero traumatization *end* The second stage is
to have a premature birth the third stage is to provide intense love for the
child for the first  months by - selected Illuminati caregivers and the
fourth stage is to pull that love away and split the mind of the child
permanently *end* Not every Illuminati child is born premature--but many are
because that is the preferred method for programming *end*

Foundation Step  *end* Preparation of the Children by Spiritual
Preparations & In Utero Traumatization--The Moon Children

The preparation for someone to be programmed also concerns the ability
of a person to be demonized *end* Generational satanic families are sold out to
Satan and their children belong to Satan in a way that non-generational
children do not *end* Because of the generational curses because of the genetic
bent toward the occult because of the generational demonic forces the
Illuminati children are very good candidates for Monarch programming *end*
Part of the programming includes the layering in of demonic forces and
the participation in blood rituals in order to draw in the most powerful of
demons *end* An indepth review about this important but controversial subject
is in chapter  *end*

The Moonchild rituals are the rituals to demonize a fetus *end* However the
demons that are invoked are not the small ones but very powerful ones *end* In
working with victims of this programming it is clear that high level
demons were placed within these people at very early ages many of them
it is believed were demonized before they were born by rituals like the
Moonchild rituals *end* Blood sacrifices and human sacrifices are always
required for this level of magic *end*

Aleister Crowley - was a Satanist who was a rd degree
Scottish Rite Freemason *end* He also was a leader in a number of other
Masonic rites as well as an OTO leader a chief in Stella Matutina and a
MI- Br *end* overseas intelligence agent *end* His writings have been important
within  century Satanism and with black magicians *end* He wrote
Moonchild which was first published in  *end* The idea of the Moonchild

is that via black magic a perfect soul can be captured *end* The belief in
reincarnation which is prevalent among the Illuminati and Satanic groups
lends itself to the belief that souls compete for a particular embryo *end* On
page -  of Moonchild the idea is expressed "To produce a man who
should not be bound up in his heredity and should have the environment
which they desired for him." This perfect soul in a proper person is called
Homunculus *end*

The magical work upon which this is based is said to be derived from
Bacon Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus who were all reported in occult
circles to have captured souls and placed them into brass statues *end* The
Hittites the people of Asia Minor and Syria have long sought the ability to
create a superman and a superwoman *end* The Illuminati’s inside occult
history places the Hittites in their ancestry *end*

Clear back in  long before superman appeared in comics and movies
Aleister Crowley was writing about a Superman *end* The magical idea is to
capture a soul from the  dimension *end* In the book Moonchild the villa
used to produce a Moonchild was called "The Butter-fly-Net" *end* The
Monarch Project then which is named after the Monarch butterfly is also
an allusion to the Moonchild project where Butterflies are an allusion to
souls what Christians call demonic spirits *end*

The actual rituals carried out to create a Moonchild are described in detail
in three of Crowley’s writings *end* A vague description of the rituals can be
seen by reading the book Moonchild *end* The ritual took place at a villa
nicknamed The Butterfly Net *end* The villa was really an occult temple laid
out in sacred geometrics *end* It had figures of satyrs fauns and nymphs *end* It had
statues of Artemis *end* Lots of silver objects and crescents and -pointed stars
were at the villa because these objects all relate to the Moon in magic *end* The
woman who was pregnant was surrounded by objects related to the moon *end*
The moon’s influence was repeatedly invoked *end* A small triangular silver
altar to Artemis was used *end* There was a sacred spring where the woman
was washed *end* The number  which is sacred to the moon was used along
with its square  *end* Prayers were made to Artemis and there was the
reenactment of the capture of Diana by Pan *end* The woman was coached to
identify herself with what is known as Grandmother Moon in the book

she simply is called the Moon or Diana by identifying her thoughts and
actions with the deities one is wanting to invoke *end*

The creation of the Moonchildren within the Monarch Project involves
high level magic by the circle of Illuminati black magicians involved with
a particular individual’s programming *end* It should be noted that Grande
Master and Grande Dame alters will understand demonology but the
sections levels of alter above them are not informed *end*

One of the biggest secrets kept from most of the slave’s alters is that their
System was demonized while a fetus *end* First this would give religious front
alters the information they need to get them on the right track towards
healing and it could also adversely affect the programming lies of some of
the front alters who don’t realize how premeditated all the trauma and
torture is *end* The front alters of victims themselves remember the cover story
that the moon children were produced via torture in the cages as little
children *end*

The Illuminati have also planned that every one of the ten commandments
of God will be violated in their favor with the child *end* They prefer the child
to be born out of wedlock so that it is a bastard *end* This breaks God’s
commandment on adultery and also gives them more leverage to destroy
the child’s self-esteem *end* This entire plan involves generational curses which
are spoken and unspoken *end* During Illuminati ceremonies Ceremonial pacts
which concern having the child out of wedlock to mock God are made *end*

While the Illuminati destroy any godly spiritual foundation they are
creating a solid rock hard foundation of "love" adoration or idolatry
within the new born upon which they will build the programming *end* The
second commandment is "Do not take the Lord’s name in vain" *end* In the
Black Mass the names of God are invoked to get spirits with blasphemous
names such as Yahweh Elohim *end* Most parts of the little child will never
even hear the Lord’s name--he will only hear the name of his master who
will someday be presented to him as "God" *end* The hand that rocks the cradle
rules the world *end* The child is being bonded to his future programmers *end*
Much later great attention will be given to set up staged events to insure
that the victim being programmed hates God *end*

In Utero Traumatization

The formal Monarch Mind-Control project was developed from
observations of high level Satanic families *end* These families had no qualms
about the concept of traumatizing the fetus *end* Italian generational witchcraft
is called the Ways of the Strega *end* These generational occult bloodlines esp *end*
in Tuscany and Naples are very much into generational ancestor spirits *end*
These were the ones that Aleister Crowley went to learn how to create
Moon Children *end*

Remember that Italian and German generational Illuminati families were
studied by the Italian fascists and the German Nazis to develop a scientific
understanding of mind control *end* The Illuminati families in Germany were
secretly and scientifically studied in the s to determine what exactly
was happening and how to systematically improve the Illuminati’s control
over the people they were already programming *end*

Discipline and training has been lavished for centuries upon the children of
these elite bloodlines *end* The contribution of the  century was the
systematic collection and scientific study of all the various methodologies
into one cohesive programming package *end* This research was begun on a
large scale in s and has been systematically added to since then *end*

Families who wanted dissociative children learned that dissociative babies
could be born if the child in the womb is tortured *end* Thin needles are
inserted through the mother into the fetus to prick the preborn child *end*
Mothers who are pregnant with children to be programmed are also
severely traumatized during their pregnancy with a whole assortment of
traumas which simultaneously traumatizes the babies which they carry *end*
For instance the father may purposely abandon the pregnant mother in the
middle of a forest or blast the mother with loud frightening music and
then follow this up with love *end*
 Contents  Back  Next

Foundation Step  *end* The Trauma of a Premature Birth

A premature birth is important because the naturally occurring events
around a premature birth insure that the child is naturally traumatized *end*
Studies such as Fenaroff  have found that only -% of the live
births were premature but  to % about a third of all battered
children were born premature *end*

It appears that the satanic cult involvement with causing premature births
may be reflected in this type of statistic *end* Some of the Illuminati-induced
premature births have made the newspapers because the preemies set
records for being born so small *end* Premature labor is induced-the fact that a
premature birth happens is not natural but the traumas that occur to the
preemie are *end*

Specialized drugs not just the exogenous oxytocins normally used to
induce labor are used on a mother to place her in a deeper trance than a
twilight sleep *end* Remember that the underdeveloped liver & kidneys of the
preemie make it difficult to naturally purge meds from the preemie’s
body *end* The mother will begin the process of delivery at this time *end*
However the mother must be brought out of this deep sleep in order to
push the baby through the birth canal *end* The baby is too weak to help with
the birthing process *end*

This is the hardest type of birth that there is because the baby is not able to
help the mother in the small ways that a full term baby would *end* The strain
on the heart of the mother is extreme *end* The Illuminati have learned that a
mother can usually give  or  preemie births like this before she risks
death to try it again *end* If this type of birth is repeated too often the woman’s
heart will fail *end* This is why the Illuminati will have their breeders give  or
 preemies for programming and then have their breeders switch to full
term babies which are used for sacrifice *end*

If we describe how breeders and babies are used we must speak in general
terms because each bloodline each baby each mother is a separate case *end*
However there are some patterns that should be pointed out *end* A bloodline

will often want a female’s first born male to be sacrificed to their belief
system and the Lilith programming which is given the alters who function
within the Kabballistic Tree of Life which is built in during Mengele’s
programming for the deeper sections levels of alters which are trained in
Illuminati black magic *end* This subject will be dealt with later *end*

The Illuminati breeders may be women who were preemies themselves *end*
Sometimes they skip a generation with the trauma of a premature birth to
get a mother with a good sound heart *end* Some of these breeders have
excellent bloodlines but during their own preemie birth their brains were
damaged and they don’t have the super-intelligence the Illuminati wants
for programming *end* However they still need to have had enough creativity
to have allowed themselves to become a programmed multiple *end*

When breeders are used by the Illuminati to obtain babies for
programming the Illuminati selects women who are themselves
programmed multiples *end* They are used for breeders because genetically
they have genes for intelligence even though they aren’t brilliant *end* These
women of lesser intelligence will only make the beginning Priestess level
of the women and might obtain a rank in that level of High Priestess *end*

All these women no matter their circumstances have been made to believe
that offering their babies to Satan is the highest honor so many of them do
not have normal qualms about their job *end* It is important to interject that the
Illuminati are Luciferians but worship Lucifer/Satan *end* Satanists are
organizationally a separate set up with a separate history but both groups
have many common practices including child sacrifice *end* There is a science
in how the Illuminati hides bloodlines sometimes families are used as
brooders for other important bloodlines *end* It will only be mentioned in
passing here because it is relevant to the selection process of how children
are slated to be programmed *end*

The Illuminati is fully aware of rare bloodtypes and other genetic
properties that run in bloodlines and breed individuals to get certain traits
and they also take into consideration that certain weaknesses such as weak
hearts or AB- negative blood with no RH factor will call for special
attention *end* The criteria for non-Illuminati cults for their breeders is much

lower *end* Often these are the cults’ leftovers *end* That is the difference between
the good breeding of the Illuminati and the degenerate thinking of the
openly satanic groups *end*

The Satanic groups which are organized into hubs and some of the lesser
occult groups like the KKK *end* have women which are kept under lock and
key to serve as breeders *end* Breeders are kept from having outside talents that
would help them function in the outside world *end* Some are not allowed to
have driver’s licenses and other basics *end*

How does the occult world manage to work things out within a hospital
setting *end* The independent satanic cults may not use hospitals *end* I have
worked with enough first hand information to be familiar with some of the
cults which have home births attended by their own midwives *end* An
example is the Satanic cult in Seminole & Garvin counties of Oklahoma
where their section houses in the countryside have had unrecorded home
births for years *end*

First hand information also confirms that hospitals in Tacoma Vancouver
Portland and San Francisco are used by the Illuminati for premature
births *end* By extension it can be understood that many hospitals across the
United States are now staffed with a large number of nurses and doctors
who are loyal to the occult world called by insiders the "Network"
headed by the Illuminati *end* The preemies are attended to by satanic witches
who are nurses many of them multiples themselves *end* Further on in this
book we will cover how the Illuminati is turning out a great number of
pediatricians via programming to insure control over the preliminary
programming stages *end*
If the occult world wants a mother to see her preemie the occult nurses on
night shifts will quietly let cult mothers in to bond with their preemies *end*
There is a lot of corruption that goes on unnoticed too *end* These doctors and
nurses have taken lots of preemies for the Network to use for programming
experiments *end* If the mother is a low income mother the Freemasons will let
them use their network of hospitals for free *end*

Some of these premature children are described as dead and taken with the

excuse that "they can’t breathe" *end* They then are used for programming
experimentation *end* The Illuminati working in conjunction with other occult
groups schemes up methods by which they can get other people’s babies *end*
This gives them additional children to work on *end* By giving low income
mothers free births at Masonic hospitals the occult world can later
contrive some reason for stripping a low income mother who is on drugs of
her guardianship of her baby *end* They take these children some of them drug
babies for programming uses *end*

The mothers of different animals are examples of how important touch is
to any baby *end* A mother cow or dog will nudge its offspring soon after it is
born *end* They will also begin to teach the baby immediately after it is born *end*
Studies have learned that most mammals lick their newborn which has
been observed to be critical for the healthy physical development of the
baby animal *end* The Illuminati want the same development for their
offspring *end* Research showed that rocking and stroking preemies helps them
develop motor skills and respiratory functions *end* It takes the place of the
licking animals give their offspring *end* The stroking even helps cardiac
heart functions during the preemies sleep *end* Giving stimulus to a part of the
brain will cause that part of the brain to grow *end* Although the premature
child cannot speak it still craves attention *end* Even if it hurts the child
wants--even needs-- to be held *end* The child can be touched and it will crave
that touching even if it hurts *end* Already the mixing of love and pain is
beginning *end* Their skin will be thin and sensitive to touch *end* It will hurt to be
touched and preemies can even have their skin bruised by a sheet *end*
A premature birth will create a fighter spirit within the child *end* If the child
does not have a strong instinct for survival and does not fight to survive
the premature birth then it will not fight to survive during the tortures of
the programming *end* By having a premature birth the selection process has
already started *end* Which child will be a fighter *end* The preemie will be
emotionally deprived of getting to suck on a real mother’s breast but will
be fed with an eye-dropper or bottle *end*

Often a transdisciplinary team will be created at the hospital to take charge
of the preemie *end* They will run one of the various standard assessments
perhaps the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale NBAS or the Bayley

Scale of Infant Development *end* Objectives will then be developed for the
short and the long term based on each infant’s identified needs *end* The NBAS
will look at a *end* the ability to shut out disturbing stimuli b *end* responsiveness to
auditory & visual stimuli c *end* muscle tone & motor skills d *end* irritability e *end*
capacity to cuddle f *end* skin color g *end* reflexes *end*
Every part of the preemie’s body will be violated *end* A Catheter will likely be
put in the little baby’s bladder because preemies’ urinary tracts tend to
close up and bed sores must be avoided too *end* They will also usually be
given I.V.s *end* This will give them more fluid to eliminate *end* This is healthy for
the Preemie to keep their kidneys well *end* However it also serves as part of
the natural traumatic process *end* Some will be given oxygen *end* The preemie
will be adjusting to the light temperature sound humidity and gravity of
the new world it has been thrust into *end* Their hearts will have problems
some of these like Mitro-valve prolapse may stay with the child for a life-
time and also often difficulties with their lungs *end*

Studies on preemies have shown that they tend to have a sober affect with
few smiles and then the smiles come only if their eyes are averted from
who is in front of them *end* They are less social and they depend upon the
primary person usually a caretaker at the hospital to give them assistance
and encouragement to interact socially *end* Als & Brazelton

When the child is born the Illuminati make sure that its first view is of one
of the people who will help program it *end* Often this is a Grande Dame within
the hierarchy but it might also be a male programmer *end* Over the following
months the programmer figure will repeatedly talk to the child in loving
cooing tones *end* The most loving soothing words are all that is permitted at
this stage *end* The child is being naturally bonded to the programmer *end* Mengele
was the best of experts at this type of bonding *end*

The programmers talk to each other in terms like "this child is a piece of
clay." They view themselves as the potters to that clay *end* When the Preemie
is born it copes with the pain by being dissociative *end* The soothing voice of
the programmer is said and heard in hypnotic tones *end* The hypnotic voice of
the programmer is taking advantage of the dissociative trance-like state of
the child in pain *end* The hypnotic voice is grooming the child from the womb *end*

Hypnotic cues are placed into the child’s mind even at this young age *end*
Hypnotic cues use all the senses *end* In reality the programmers are even
hypnotizing the little babies *end* Soon the preemie’s eyes will open when the
preemie senses the presence of the programmer in the room *end* The preemie’s
eyes will follow the programmer around as he or she walks around the
child’s room *end* The child’s eyes are following the voice of the programmer *end*
Ronald Shor a respected researcher into hypnotism wrote in the Amer *end*
Journal of Psychotherapy Vol *end*   pp *end* -

"Only in the fetus can one conceive of an ideally pure trance
state that is a state in which there is a total absence of a
functioning reality-orientation *end* In the developing organism in
utero the first momentary experiences exist concretely
independent of any structured background of experience *end* The
only organization that can take place at first is that which is
genetically given *end* But except for this natural ontogenetically
undeveloped state there is always some degree of structuring."

In other words if you want to hypnotize someone the ideal is when they
are a fetus because the baby soon begins to get a grasp of reality--that
reality gives the child something to compare with what the hypnotist is
wanting to program in *end* Notice also the awareness on Shor’s part that
there is some structuring of the mind done naturally via genetics *end*

This again underscores the importance of why the programmers like multi-
generational victims--because they pass via genetics some of the mental
structuring needed for the smooth programming of the next generation *end* By
looking into the preemie’s eyes and talking the programmer begins to
teach the baby *end* The preemie learns that its primary caretaker is its
controller *end* The controller controls its access to its bottle and everything
else in its life *end* The Illuminati are teaching the child to view its controller as
God from the first second it is born *end* They want the child to worship the
programmer *end* The programmer is literally saving the preemie’s life *end* By
talking & cooing to the child the programmer’s voice becomes more real
to the child than itself *end*
The controllers begin stretching the mind of the child as soon as it is born *end*
The two or three people who control the early baby’s life begin teaching it
with hypnotic voices as soon as it is born *end* Subliminal tapes are used to
teach the baby immediately *end* The goal is to teach the child to read and
speak much earlier than other children *end* In the Monarch Program’s
controlled setting children who can read at six months can still be
programmed for social skills *end* In an uncontrolled setting children taught
this earlier tend to have their intellectual skills outstrip their social skills
and they develop serious problems with their peers and schools *end*

Children can be hypnotized easier than adults but it has to be done
differently especially if the child is preverbal *end* Rubbing the child stroking
its head and patting the child help soothe the child into relaxing *end* The
hypnotist must not make rapid tonal changes in his voice *end* These are
reasons why gentle Illuminati women programmers are such an asset at
this stage *end* The newborn child is taught obedience *end* It is allowed to cry to
develop its lungs but at some early point it is taught not to cry *end* Tape is
placed over the child’s mouth and it is told over and over "no" with the
index finger gesturing *end* They get approval if they don’t cry *end* This type of
programming is called behavior modification and will be further covered
in a later chapter *end*

The baby is rigidly taught total obedience *end* In review of step  one tried
and often used technique is to have the baby born premature *end* The baby
must undergo lots of trauma and must learn to be a fighter to survive *end*
Babies have been taken by induced labor or C-Section at premature ages
intentionally to insure that the baby will suffer trauma *end* When the
premature baby leaves the comfort of the womb it experiences trauma *end* By
taking the baby prematurely it also gives the programmers an advanced
start on the programming *end*
Foundation Step  *end* Love Bombing the Child Until about Eighteen Months

The third stage is smothering the child in love *end* The love is given so that it
can be taken away in the fourth stage *end* Unless love is given so that it can be
taken away there is no trauma *end* Illuminati children are never spanked in

the first year and a half *end* They are very lovingly controlled *end* This pattern of
smothering new converts in love called "love bombing" in preparation for
removing that love and acceptance to get obedience is done by some cults
to new members too *end*

The Illuminati child learns about their body *end* Their bowels are allowed to
function properly and they are kept meticulously clean *end* They must be
taught to appreciate their body before the trauma of stripping them of
everything they value *end* Dissociation does not have to be taught to the child
because they have a genetic leaning toward it and the premature birth has
taught them to dissociate *end* All in all the child has been allowed only to
build a relationship with its programmers *end* The child has learned to trust
obey and adore the programmer during the first  months of its life *end* Its
mind is lining up with hypnotic suggestions cues and is being obedient *end*

Foundation Step
Fracturing the Mind

The fourth stage is built upon the foundation of dissociation created in the
first & second stages and the love created in the third stage *end* The
demonology of the first step also helps pull in demons associated with
programming tunneling in the mind and multiplicity which are used in
the fourth foundational step *end*
Often in the fourth step the child’s mind will fracture along the same
dissociation fracture lines that the trauma of the premature birth created *end* If
the child is not a premature baby it will need some additional help to want
to dissociate *end* The child can have its senses overwhelmed repeatedly to the
point that it learns to react to its surroundings by what appears on the
outside as a numbness and mentally is simply dissociation *end*

Everything imaginable can be used to overwhelm the caged little child’s
senses and create dissociation *end* Rotten faul odors of the child’s excrement
of amnonia and rotten food while it huddles in its cage will overwhelm the
child’s sense of smell *end* Being fed blood overwhelms the sense of taste *end* The
chanting of the Programmers dressed in Satanic garb banging noises rock
music and the electric hum and ultrasonic stimulation overwhelms the
child’s sense of hearing *end* The child’s natural developing sense of shapes is
taken advantage of by spinning the child and making it feel like it is going
to fall *end* The child will also be deprived of sleep and drugged *end* Together all
this will provide the dissociative base for splitting the core *end*

The fourth stage is to strip the child of everything nice and lovely in the
world *end* The child is caged and tormented by electric shock *end* The child’s
senses will be overloaded and they will become numb *end* Eyewitnesses have
described these hundreds of numbed children as "zombies" *end* This stage and
the programming put in after the foundational dissociation is created will
form the next chapter *end*
In the fourth step the child is starved cold and naked *end*
